 <description>It is pleasure to be here today.

Thank you, Governor McDonnell for convening such a great group of leaders to discuss how Virginians can use innovation to drive education reform. 

Today, I want to discuss the often neglected link between standards and innovation. Even the very words &quot;standards&quot; and &quot;innovation&quot; seem at odds with each other. </description>

 <description>Good morning. It&#039;s a great honor to be here today among America&#039;s faith leaders. It&#039;s an even greater honor to follow in the shoes of heroes like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who spoke here in 1962.

Not a day goes by that I don&#039;t think of him, and draw inspiration from him.</description>
