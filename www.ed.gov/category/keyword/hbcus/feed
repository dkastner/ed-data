 <item> <title>The HBCU Value Proposition</title>
 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/hbcu-value-proposition</link>
 <description>At the 2014 National HBCU convention, Secretary Duncan affirmed the value of HBCUs to achieving national educational goals, such as regaining America&#039;s lead in college attainment, strengthening the STEM fields and the teaching profession, expanding diversity, and encouraging innovation and international education. He also addressed concerns that HBCU leaders have raised about several Obama administration initiatives, and thanked the leadership of HBCUs for helping to improve and strengthen a number of administration policies. Along with his counterparts at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Peace Corps, and the Corporation for Community and National Service, Secretary Duncan encouraged more use of Public Service Loan Forgiveness to reduce student debt for those who are working full-time in government jobs or at tax-exempt non-profits.

Just four days from now, Republicans on Capitol Hill are threatening to shut down the government.</description>
