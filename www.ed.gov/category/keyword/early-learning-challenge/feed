 <item> <title>Race to the Top - Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC) Program</title>
 <link>https://www.ed.gov/early-learning/elc-draft-summary</link>
 <description>Thank you for your interest in the RTT-ELC Program, the administration&#039;s signature early learning reform initiative. This program will be jointly administered by the U.S. Departments of Education (ED) and Health and Human Services (HHS). 

In order to run a rigorous competition and obligate funds to grantees before the December 31, 2011 statutory deadline, ED will waive rulemaking for this new program, pursuant to its authority in the General Education Provisions Act. However, we want your input on how we implement the major elements of this program so we are posting this draft executive summary of the draft requirements, priorities, selection criteria, and definitions for the RTT-ELC competition on this Web site and we encourage all interested parties to share their comments with us.
