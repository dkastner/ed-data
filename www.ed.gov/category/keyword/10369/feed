 <description>Thank you, Jermaine--and my thanks to the Student Government Association and to all of the class of 2011 for having me here today.

First things first--let me just say how disappointed Secretary Duncan was that he couldn&#039;t make the trip today. But he asked me to convey his praise and pride for the hard work that brought you to this graduation day and earning your degree.</description>

 <description>Thank you, President Murphy. It&#039;s a pleasure to be here this morning to join in celebrating the class of 2010&#039;s success.

I want to begin with a confession today: I was a little intimidated to learn about some of the celebrity orators who speak at commencement ceremonies in the Bay Area.</description>

 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/finding-your-passion-remarks-secretary-arne-duncan-benjamin-banneker-high-school-commencement</link>
 <description>Good afternoon, students, parents and teachers.

I am here today to celebrate your success and Banneker&#039;s success.  They often say that success has many parents.   

Your success is earned, first of all, from your hard work and perseverance -- qualities that are in each of you -- and so I begin by saluting you, the class of 2010.
