 <description>&quot;It is good news for our nation&#039;s schools that the House has passed a serious bipartisan plan to fix the No Child Left Behind law.

 <description> &quot;It is good news for our nation&#039;s schools that Congress is taking the next step forward toward a serious bipartisan plan to revamp the outdated No Child Left Behind law.

 <description>Two years ago, I came to Washington with one goal-- to give every single child in America the very best education possible.

While I was optimistic about what we could accomplish, I never imagined we would be where we are today.

Over the last two years, we have seen more change in our education system than we&#039;ve seen over the past two decades.</description>
