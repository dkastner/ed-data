 <description>Thank you! What a wonderful convention we have here today! As I look around Freedom Hall, I am so hopeful about our nation&#039;s future.

In this crowd of 15,000 strong are the future leaders of America. I see future farmers and ranchers&amp;#151;and so much more.</description>

 <item> <title>The New Narrative of Rural Education</title>
 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/new-narrative-rural-education</link>
 <description>Thank you, Dr. Ross, for that kind introduction and for being a great partner in reform.

I&#039;m pleased to be here today to address the Rural Education National Forum because, too often, the challenges of rural education are neglected.

After nearly five years in Washington, I&#039;ve learned that much of the public narrative surrounding education is wrong or badly exaggerated.</description>
