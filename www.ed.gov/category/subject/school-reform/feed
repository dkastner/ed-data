 <description>In his remarks to the National Academy Foundation (NAF), Secretary Duncan emphasized the need to close the nation&#039;s skills gap by equipping all students to succeed in college and careers, and noted the value of providing rigorous and relevant school-based and work-based learning opportunities as a part of that preparation.  Prior to the Secretary&#039;s remarks, business and industry leaders joined NAF officials to announce the launch of the NAFTrack Certified Hiring Partnership that will give students who complete and earn the NAF credential, one that is based on assessments linked to college- and career-ready standards, priority in these employers&#039; hiring processes.  The partnering companies include: HP, Verizon, AT&amp;T, EMC, Juniper Networks, KPMG, RBC Capital Markets, US, Xerox, JPMorgan Chase, and Cisco.

 <item> <title>The New Narrative of Rural Education</title>
 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/new-narrative-rural-education</link>
 <description>Thank you, Dr. Ross, for that kind introduction and for being a great partner in reform.

I&#039;m pleased to be here today to address the Rural Education National Forum because, too often, the challenges of rural education are neglected.

After nearly five years in Washington, I&#039;ve learned that much of the public narrative surrounding education is wrong or badly exaggerated.</description>

 <description>In what seems to have become an annual ritual, I&#039;m here again today to report on the state of education in America. What I can tell you after nearly five years in Washington is that the public narrative that you hear inside the Beltway and online doesn&#039;t reflect the reality I see in classrooms and schools all across America.</description>

The theme of this leadership conference—&quot;building bridges&quot;—is fitting.
