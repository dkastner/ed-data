 <item> <title>Statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan on Congressional process for reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act</title>
 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-arne-duncan-congressional-process-reauthorization-elementary-and-secondary-education-act</link>
 <description> &quot;It is good news for our nation&#039;s schools that Congress is taking the next step forward toward a serious bipartisan plan to revamp the outdated No Child Left Behind law. America&#039;s students deserve a bill that increases educational opportunity for all and lives up to the civil rights legacy of the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act.</description>

 <item> <title>Statement by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan on the Student Loan Compromise</title>
 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-arne-duncan-student-loan-compromise</link>
 <description>&quot;I applaud the bipartisan compromise reached by President Obama and lawmakers on Capitol Hill, offering relief to millions of students and families across the country. The law will cut rates on nearly all new federal student loans and save undergraduates an average of more than $1,500 on loans taken out this year. It is an encouraging step forward in our effort to keep college affordable.

 <description>&quot;America&#039;s families, students and teachers deserve an education law that advances progress for all studentsâ€”especially our most vulnerable children. The bill that the House passed today is not that law.</description>
