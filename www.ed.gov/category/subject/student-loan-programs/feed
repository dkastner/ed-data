 <item> <title>Statement by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan on the Student Loan Compromise</title>
 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-arne-duncan-student-loan-compromise</link>
 <description>&quot;I applaud the bipartisan compromise reached by President Obama and lawmakers on Capitol Hill, offering relief to millions of students and families across the country. The law will cut rates on nearly all new federal student loans and save undergraduates an average of more than $1,500 on loans taken out this year. It is an encouraging step forward in our effort to keep college affordable.
