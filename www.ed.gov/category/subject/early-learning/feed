 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/top-ten-list-why-expansion-high-quality-early-learning-inevitable</link>
 <description>Thank you, Governor Beshear. It’s great to be back at the NGA. And I welcome this opportunity to talk about the role of early learning with our governors. On both sides of the political aisle, it’s the governors who are really leading the nation in expanding high-quality early learning, from birth to age five.</description>

 <description>My thanks to Ron Haskins, and the Brookings Institution, for hosting this discussion about President Obama&#039;s landmark proposal for high-quality preschool. 

And I&#039;m happy to see Congresswoman Nancy Johnson, who&#039;s been a longtime champion for children and a great thought-partner on the President&#039;s proposal.</description>

 <description>I&#039;m delighted to be here, and thrilled to have an opportunity to honor the extraordinary life and career of a dear friend, and one of my heroes, Barbara Bowman.

 <description>Secretary Sebelius has been a great advocate for children and a fantastic partner with ED in our work together on early learning. I can&#039;t thank her enough for stepping up to do the right thing for children.

It&#039;s good to be back at the release of NIEER&#039;s annual state of preschool yearbook--though to be frank, I wish this year&#039;s analysis had more good news to report.</description>

 <link>https://www.ed.gov/early-learning/elc-draft-summary</link>
 <description>Thank you for your interest in the RTT-ELC Program, the administration&#039;s signature early learning reform initiative. This program will be jointly administered by the U.S. Departments of Education (ED) and Health and Human Services (HHS). 

In order to run a rigorous competition and obligate funds to grantees before the December 31, 2011 statutory deadline, ED will waive rulemaking for this new program, pursuant to its authority in the General Education Provisions Act. However, we want your input on how we implement the major elements of this program so we are posting this draft executive summary of the draft requirements, priorities, selection criteria, and definitions for the RTT-ELC competition on this Web site and we encourage all interested parties to share their comments with us.

 <link>https://www.ed.gov/early-learning-old</link>
 <description>President Obama is committed to providing the support that our youngest children need to succeed later in school. The importance of the early years in a child&#039;s life has been well documented. The Department of Education (ED) prioritizes improving the health, social, emotional, and educational outcomes for young children from birth through 3rd grade by: 

enhancing the quality of early learning programs, and 
increasing the access to high quality early learning programs especially for young children at risk for school failure.
