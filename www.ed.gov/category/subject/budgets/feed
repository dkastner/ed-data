 <item> <title>Statement for the Record by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan on the U.S. Department of Education Fiscal Year 2015 Budget Request</title>
 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/statement-record-secretary-education-arne-duncan-us-department-education-fiscal-year-2015-budget-request</link>
 <description>I want to begin by thanking Congress for your work on the 2014 appropriation for education. I appreciate the funding  increases that you included in the fiscal year 2014 appropriation. However, it’s important to recognize that  total discretionary funding for the Department of Education, excluding Pell Grants, remains below the fiscal year 2010 level, and I worry about the long-term impact of the continuing slide in Federal education funding on the health of our economy and our democracy.</description>

 <item> <title>Opening Statement, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan--Release of NIEER&#039;s &quot;The State of Preschool 2012&quot; Yearbook</title>
 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/opening-statement-us-secretary-education-arne-duncan-release-nieers-state-preschool-2012-yearbook</link>
 <description>Secretary Sebelius has been a great advocate for children and a fantastic partner with ED in our work together on early learning. I can&#039;t thank her enough for stepping up to do the right thing for children.

It&#039;s good to be back at the release of NIEER&#039;s annual state of preschool yearbook--though to be frank, I wish this year&#039;s analysis had more good news to report.</description>
