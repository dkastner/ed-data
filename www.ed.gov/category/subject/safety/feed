 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-secretary-duncan-presidents-recommendations-and-actions-reducing-gun-violence</link>
 <description>I have been proud to serve President Obama and this administration since day one, but today was one of my proudest days. The actions that the President is taking and proposing to reduce gun violence echo what America&#039;s educators say they need to better protect and support students in school and in their communities.</description>

 <description>Thanks to the Chavez Middle School band and the Thomas Elementary school children&#039;s choir. Thank you for that beautiful music. 

It&#039;s a bittersweet day today. We need to listen carefully to the voices of children at this moment. We need to savor their innocence, and applaud their unquenchable appetite for self-expression and renewal.</description>

 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-secretary-education-arne-duncan-newtown-connecticut-school-shootings</link>
 <description>&quot;School shootings are always incomprehensible and horrific tragedies. But words fail to describe today&#039;s heartbreaking and savage attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School. As the father of two children in elementary school, I can barely imagine the anguish and losses suffered today by the Newtown community.</description>

 <description>&quot;My thoughts are with the Perry Hall High School communityÂ—students, families and facultyÂ—in this difficult time.
 
&quot;Gun violence has no place anywhere, least of all in our nation&#039;s schools. I&#039;d like to thank the local educators and law enforcement personnel who took action to help prevent additional students from getting hurt.</description>

 <description>&quot;The study released today shines a light on a problem too often in the dark&amp;#151;youth violence. Schools should be safe havens where young people can learn and prosper, and anything less than that is unacceptable. We&#039;ve met with students affected by the fatal beating of Derrion Albert in Chicago and brought teens struggling with the issue of dating violence here to Washington.</description>
