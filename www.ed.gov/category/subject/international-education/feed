As we get started, I want to thank Maureen McLaughlin and her staff, for their dedicated work on international affairs here at the Department – and for helping pull together this event and the week&#039;s activities. </description>

 <item> <title>Improving Human Capital in a Competitive World -— Education Reform in the U.S.</title>
 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/improving-human-capital-competitive-world-%E2%80%94-education-reform-us</link>
 <description>When the World Bank was founded in 1944, much of Europe, Russia, and Japan lay in ruin.

 <description>It is an absolute honor to address UNESCO. During the last 65 years, UNESCO has done so much to advance the cause of education and gender equity, alleviate poverty, and promote peace.  When UNESCO was founded in 1945, much of Europe, Russia, and Japan lay in ruin.</description>
