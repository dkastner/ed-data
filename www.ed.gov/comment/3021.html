<p><strong><u>Principal evaluation system:</u></strong>  A system that: (1) will be used for continual improvement of instruction; (2) meaningfully differentiates performance using at least three performance levels; (3) uses multiple valid measures in determining performance levels, including as a significant factor data on student growth(as defined in this document) for all students (including English learners and students with disabilities), and other measures of professional practice (which may be gathered through multiple formats and sources, such as observations based on rigorous leadership performance standards, teacher  evaluation data, and student and parent surveys); (4) evaluates principals on a regular basis; (5) provides clear, timely, and useful feedback, including feedback that identifies needs for and guides professional development; and (6) will be used to inform personnel decisions.  </p>

<p><strong><u>School board evaluation:</u></strong>  An assessment of the LEA school board that both evaluates performance and encourages professional growth. This evaluation system rating should reflect both (1) the feedback of many stakeholders, including but not limited to educators and parents; and (2) student outcomes performance in order to provide a detailed and accurate picture of the board's performance. </p>

<p><strong><u>School leadership team:</u></strong>  A team that is composed of the principal or other head of a school, teachers and other educators, and, as applicable, other school employees, parents, students, and other community members, and leads the implementation of improvement and other initiatives at the school.

<p><strong><u>Student survey:</u></strong>  Measures students' perspectives on teaching, learning, and related supports in their classrooms and schools.  The surveys must be research-based, valid, and reliable.  Over time these results should be predictive of rates of student growth. </p>

<p><strong><u>Student Growth:</u></strong>  The change in student achievement for an individual student between two or more points in time, defined as&#151; </p>
<ol>
<li>For grades and subjects in which assessments are required under ESEA section 1111(b)(3):  (1) a student's score on such assessments and (2) other measures of student learning, such as those described in the second bullet, provided they are rigorous and comparable across schools within an LEA. </li>
<li>For grades and subjects in which assessments are not required under ESEA section 1111(b)(3):  alternative measures of student learning and performance, such as student results on pre-tests, end-of-course tests, and objective performance-based assessments; performance against student learning objectives; student performance on English language proficiency assessments; and other measures of student achievement that are rigorous and comparable across schools within an LEA.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><u>Student-level data:</u></strong>  Demographic, performance, and other information that pertains to a single student but cannot be attributed to a specific student. </p>

<p><strong><u>Student performance data:</u></strong>  Information about the academic progress of a single student, such as formative and summative assessment data, coursework, instructor observations, information about student engagement and time on task, and similar information. </p>

<p><strong><u>Teacher attendance:</u></strong>  During the regular school year, the average percentage of days that teachers are present when they would otherwise be expected to be teaching students in an assigned class.  Teachers should not be considered present for days taken for sick leave and/or personal leave. Personal leave includes voluntary absences for reasons other than sick leave.  </p>

<p><strong><u>Teacher evaluation system:</u></strong>  System that:  (1) will be used for continual improvement of instruction; (2) meaningfully differentiates performance using at least three performance levels; (3) uses multiple valid measures in determining performance levels, including as a significant factor data on student growth (as defined in this document) for all students (including English learners and students with disabilities), and other measures of professional practice (which may be gathered through multiple formats and sources, such as observations based on rigorous teacher performance standards, teacher portfolios, and student and parent surveys); (4) evaluates teachers on a regular basis; (5) provide clear, timely, and useful feedback, including feedback that identifies needs and guides professional development; and (6) will be used to inform personnel decisions.  </p>

<p><strong><u>Turnaround strategy:</u></strong> As defined by the School Improvement Grant (SIG) regulations, published in the <cite>Federal Register</cite> on October 28, 2010 (75 FR 66363), turnaround model, restart model, school closure, or transformational model.  </p>

<p>-	Achievement gap<br />
The proposed definition of Achievement gap (“the difference in the performance between each ESEA subgroup (as defined in this document) within a participating LEA or school and the statewide average performance of the LEA's or State's highest achieving subgroups in reading/language arts and mathematics as measured by the assessments required under the ESEA”) would restrict the achievement of students in low achieving subgroups, including students with disabilities, to a standard reliant on the average for the LEA or State. Given the variance across States in academic performance (such as the NAEP), this approach would not result in significant achievement gap improvement in low performing states.<br />
NCLD recommends that the Department re-examine this definition and remove the limitations created by comparison to within LEA or within State averages.</p>
<p>-	Personalized learning plan<br />
Students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) should not be precluded from receiving a personalized learning plan. The development of such plans does not replace the requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). NCLD requests the Department to clarify these points in the definition.</p>
<p>-	Response to Intervention or Multi-Tier System of Supports<br />
NCLD recommends adding the following definition:<br />
The terms Response to Intervention and Multi-Tier System of Support mean a comprehensive program that includes evidence based instruction, universal screening, progress monitoring, research-based interventions matched to student needs, and educational decision-making using learning rate over time and level of performance.</p>

<p>Personalized Learning Plan Definition:<br />
NAEYC commends the Department for focusing on personalized learning.  We believe that the definition of personalized learning and its application must be expanded to encompass the use of developmentally appropriate practices for children in third grade and younger.  Developmentally appropriate practice is grounded both in the research on how young children develop and learn and in what is known about effective early education.  The core of developmentally appropriate practice is intentionality in making the many long-term and short-term decisions that add up to practice that promotes young children’s optimal learning and development. Developmentally appropriate practice does not mean making things easier for children. Rather, it means ensuring that goals and experiences are suited to their learning and development and challenging enough to promote their progress and interest.  To make good decisions, teachers must take into consideration what they know (1) about child development and learning; (2) about each child as an individual; and (3) about the social and cultural contexts each child lives in.  The guidelines for developmentally appropriate practice address decision making in five key practice areas: (1) Creating a caring community of learners; (2) Teaching to enhance development and learning; (3) Planning curriculum to achieve important goals; (4) Assessing children’s development and learning; and (5) Establishing reciprocal relationships with families.  Developmental variation among children is the norm, and any one child’s progress also will vary across domains and disciplines, contexts, and time.  </p>
<p>Recommendation: The definition of Personalized Learning Plan should be expanded to encompass the use of developmentally appropriate practices for children in third grade and younger, thus intentionally providing a basis for long- and short-term practice decisions that promote optimal learning and development.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Student Growth Definition:</p>
<p>The draft definition of Student Growth for grades and subjects in which assessments are not required under ESEA section 1111(b)(3) is defined in this proposal as student results on pre tests, end of course tests, objective performance–based assessments and performance on student learning objectives, as well as student performance on English language proficiency assessments.  We applaud the Department for encouraging the use of high-quality assessments of student progress beyond those defined under ESEA, as well as the inclusion of assessment approaches (e.g. instructor observations) that are more typical in the early grades, and can be employed according to the highest standards of assessment practice.  </p>
<p>Recommendation:  The application should require districts and schools working under this grant to ensure that their selection and use of child assessments for children in third grade and younger conform to the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences reports on child assessment.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Teacher Evaluation System Definition:</p>
<p>The proposed definition of a Teacher Evaluation System does not distinguish between effective teaching in the early grades and teaching of older children.  The definition in this proposal states that the evaluation system must use multiple valid measures in determining performance levels, including as a significant factor data on student growth (defined in the draft as for all students) and other measures of professional practice, a significant purpose of which will be to inform personnel decisions. </p>
<p>Many variables contribute to a teacher’s effectiveness: their preservice education and ongoing professional development, classroom resources, and the availability of services that children may need to meet challenging academic expectations.  The evaluation process should be used as a way to inform, improve and plan for better teaching and a better school climate.  In thinking of evaluation as part of a continuous improvement process, evaluations can be more meaningful and more focused.  For example, the CLASS assessment of teacher-child interaction is part of a professional development process.  The merits of value added assessment, in general, and the specific weighting of student outcome data as part of teacher accountability systems continues to be debated.  The unintended consequences of using assessments of children in preschool through third grade for teacher, principal and school accountability and associated incentives can include: 1) undue pressure on children regarding test taking rather than the comprehensive and critical thinking skills which are needed for 21st century jobs; 2) teachers “teaching to the test,” which could narrow the curriculum; and 3) inaccurate reflections of children’s real abilities.</p>
<p>Data on student growth should not be the “significant” factor in this system for teachers in the early grades, especially kindergarten.  Child outcome assessments do not capture this important element of teacher effectiveness and by determining high stakes outcomes for teachers on child outcomes alone, other critical skills for teachers will be diminished in value and use.  Effective teachers know how to use the curriculum and instructional assessments to support each child’s learning and how to engage families as partners in children’s development and education.  By placing such emphasis on student test scores for teachers working with children in K-3, there will be the potential for more unnecessary, burdensome testing and “test prep” and a narrowing of the curriculum to only those subjects tested under the common standards. </p>
<p>Kindergarten is a unique year in our education system and further complicates a K-12 Teacher Evaluation System that does not recognize the differences in the early grades and student development compared to older children and later grades.  Many districts are not required to provide kindergarten.  Some districts provide half day, and others provide full day (including a second-half of day for a fee) kindergarten year.  Children entering kindergarten come with a wide variety of experiences prior to the kindergarten year, including no group educational experience outside of the home.  Some districts partner with Head Start and other early childhood education programs in the community to ensure a continuum of learning and parent engagement while others are more disconnected from each other.  </p>
<p>Recommendation:  The definition should include a phrase that states:  “For the purpose of a system evaluating teachers in third grade and earlier, child assessment data should conform with the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences regarding child and student assessment and should not be used for high-stakes personnel decisions.”  Applicants should be encouraged to develop models with input from multiple stakeholders to ensure that appropriate accountability processes for teachers are developed, and to ensure clarity and transparency in the process from the outset.</p>

<p>The distinct  needs of  young children warrent different definitions and different practices.</p>
<p> True developmentally appropriate practices based on research are what need to be implemented. What is appropriate for older children is not appropriate for younger children. This is true for the day to day instruction in programs as well as for assessment tools . Our natioanl policies must reflect this better. An amended Personalized Learning Plan could be a viable vehicle for this.</p>
<p>Similarly a revised teacher effectiveness plan would also need to reflect the age group of the children and how that impacts a teacher's professional practices.</p>

Since school board's are typically elected, the evaluation is in the hands of the voters. Is this definition implying a different evaluation system similiar to the type a Principal or Teacher would go through? Thanks for clarifying.</p>

I do have a concern that there is not a mandate for districts to contract with an external partner to assist them in the reform process.  My organization has been actively involved in supporting PLAs through SIG grants over the last several years.  We have seen some states require external partner and others have not.  The schools with an external partner appear to be more successful than those who do not.  </p>
<p>I also did not see the timeline for expending funds.  I understand the funding is to start by Dec. 31, 2012 but didn't see end.  </p>
<p>Finally, need to clarify the budget amounts - is that total amount over X years or annual amounts.</p>
