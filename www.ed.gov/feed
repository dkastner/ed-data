 <description>Education is the great engine of our democracy, and the fuel for that engine is the opportunities students have to engage in activism on issues that are important to them.</description>

 <item> <title>A New Principal — Again</title>
 <link>https://blog.ed.gov/2017/01/a-new-principal-again/</link>
 <description>Nine times in twenty-eight years of teaching I’ve gone through the training of a new principal in my high school.  Nine times! And to make matters more frustrating, the replacement always seems to be the philosophical and pedagogical opposite of the one he or she is replacing.</description>

 <description>A few months ago, I had the opportunity to meet with Benetech, one of our grantees, and observe some of the tools they have developed under their Department grant to help visually impaired people access the content of graphics in books.  The tool has many applications, including giving visually impaired children the opportunity to better enjoy picture books and high school students better access to information in graphics and diagrams in science books.</description>

 <item> <title>New Report Shows Increased Need for Federal Investments in Early Learning</title>
 <link>https://blog.ed.gov/2017/01/new-report-shows-increased-need-federal-investments-early-learning/</link>
 <description>Are there too many federal early learning programs?  This question has been contentiously debated and discussed in Washington, DC for years.  Are programs that simply permit funding for early learning as a part of a larger initiative, such as Title I or English Language Acquisition grants, considered early learning programs?  Should programs that merely mention the importance of early learning – the Appalachian Area Development grants or Donations of Federal Surplus Personal Property program – be considered early learning programs?</description>

 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/american-career-institute-borrowers-receive-automatic-group-relief-federal-student-loans</link>
 <description>The U.S. Department of  Education (ED) announced today plans to grant borrower defense relief for  federal student loan borrowers who attended the now-defunct American Career  Institute (ACI) in Massachusetts. This move follows the Department’s  investigation as well as numerous admissions by the school that it made false  and misleading representations to students, misstated job placement rates and  employed instructors who were unauthorized to teach under applicable state  laws.</description>

 <item> <title>More Transparency in Higher Education Will Help Improve Student Outcomes</title>
 <link>https://blog.ed.gov/2017/01/transparency-higher-education-will-help-improve-student-outcomes/</link>
 <description>Every year, the U.S. Department of Education provides billions of dollars in Federal financial aid to help students enroll in college. Yet too many students—roughly two in five bachelor’s degree-seeking students—leave school with no degree, often leaving them with debt, no job, and a high risk of default. In recent years, the Department has made strides toward improving these odds, yet more work remains.</description>

 <link>https://blog.ed.gov/2017/01/believe-in-your-power/</link>
 <description>On Thursday, January 12, thousands of teachers across the nation will receive appreciation phone calls from the Department of Education. These educators were nominated by their colleagues, parents, and students to receive a call. As a Teaching Ambassador Fellow, I had a chance to read the comments stating why each educator deserved personalized appreciation.
“He has been a beacon of light and hope for my daughter who sometimes struggles but has so much to offer the world. He challenges and educates, but most of all he cares.”</description>

 <item> <title>What Gets Measured, Gets Done: DC Public Schools’ FAFSA Completion Initiative</title>
 <link>https://blog.ed.gov/2017/01/gets-measured-gets-done-dc-public-schools-fafsa-completion-initiative/</link>
 <description>Let’s state the obvious: 1) Financial aid plays a huge factor in students’ college-going decisions and success (especially low-income students); and 2) Completing the FAFSA is essential for students to access almost all forms of financial aid. So, for a large urban district like DC Public Schools, where 77 percent of our students qualify for free and reduced price lunch, getting graduating seniors to complete their FAFSAs on time isn’t an optional task- it’s a necessary one.</description>

 <item> <title>A New Year, A Fresh Perspective</title>
 <link>https://blog.ed.gov/2017/01/new-year-fresh-perspective/</link>
 <description>Even though we are halfway through the school year, the start of 2017 is the perfect opportunity for a fresh perspective on my classroom. Just like I did with my home over break, I plan to reorganize my room and purge any resources that I no longer need. If I haven’t used it yet at this point in the year, chances are I don’t actually need it and it should go. Of course, I don’t want to throw out anything that could be useful to someone else, so I will give them away to a teacher, tutor, or student that will put them to good use. After all, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.</description>

That’s why the  President has called on Congress to make two years of community college free so  that students can earn the skills needed to succeed in the workforce or the first  half of a bachelor’s degree at no cost.</description>

 <description>New analysis released today by the U.S. Department of Education reveals many  for-profit schools would likely exceed the 90/10 federal funding limits if  revenue from Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense  (DOD) programs were included in the 90/10 calculation the same way Title IV  funds are included. The annual 90/10 report also released today finds 17  for-profit colleges out of compliance with existing federal funding limits. </description>
