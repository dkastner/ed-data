It&rsquo;s good to be home. I will say a couple of things before I  start. First off, Christina (Waters). I met her, I recall meeting her when she  was in the hospital fighting for her life. She had gone through elementary  school to Ariel Community Academy. Great student. Fantastic basketball player. (Inaudible).  Was going in a couple of days to college to compete. Was at a church social and  was shot there in the head. Don&rsquo;t know why. Don&rsquo;t know by whom. Somehow through  that tragedy, she has gone on to do amazing things. I met with a group of young  people like Christina unfortunately just a couple of weeks ago in my office  from across the nation who had experienced gun violence. Her leadership, her  passion, her ability to inspire them was remarkable. Whatever we can do to see  her become the young leader that she is going to be, we ought to be behind her.  Please give her another round of applause.</p>
<p>Father  Pfleger. I have said this before. He and I have laughed together. We have  marched together. We have cried together. I hope to do more marching, hope to  see a lot more laughing and a lot less crying. His heart, his commitment has  inspired me and so many of us for so long. We are lucky to have a leader like  him in Chicago&rsquo;s Southside. Please give him a round of applause. </p>
<p>Why  here? Why a church basement? It wasn&rsquo;t an accident. My life&rsquo;s work started in a  church basement. Movements have come out of church basements. We could have  been in a fancy hotel downtown. We could have done something else. But that  didn&rsquo;t feel right. This feels like home. If we can use church basements here in  the Southside, the Westside, not just in Chicago, but across the nation, to  move our country where we need to go, hopefully some of that can start here. <br />
  <br />
  This  is speech 257 for me. That&rsquo;s more than enough. Probably 255 too many. So happy  to be with you. (I will) say some things. Happy to take your questions afterwards,  but thrilled to be here in a church basement. </p>
<p>This  is supposed to be a time of reflection. I would love to spend the next half  hour or so talking about all the great things we&rsquo;ve accomplished and there&rsquo;s a  lot that I am amazingly proud of. Thrilled that we were able to put more than  $1 billion behind early childhood, an unprecedented investment. But I&rsquo;ll come  back to that later. Thrilled that graduation rates are at an all-time high‚Äî82  percent. Thrilled that there were significant reductions in dropout rates.  African-Americans dropout rates cut by 45 percent. Latino dropout rates cut in  half, from 28 to 14 percent. We used to have 2,000 high school that were quote  unquote dropout factories. Today, that&rsquo;s down to 1,000. With high school  graduation rates up, and dropout rates down, we have more than 1.1 million  additional students of color, not just graduating from high school, but going  on to college. The progress is real. (I) would love to spend lots of time  talking about those things and the stories behind them. </p>
<p>But  that&rsquo;s really not what moves me today. What moves me today is not the past, but  the present and the future and how far we still have to go. Spending time  thinking about what was done in the past but what lies ahead. I think like you,  I feel this huge sense of urgency. That we have to do better, we have to more  for our young people. This is not some &ldquo;mission accomplished&rdquo; moment - not by  any stretch.</p>
<p>If  I could leave you with one number‚Äî16,000. In my first six years as Secretary of  Education, that&rsquo;s the number of young people who were killed across our country.  16,000. That&rsquo;s an average of 7 a day. That&rsquo;s a devastating rate of loss. White,  black, Latino, urban, rural, suburban. This is a Chicago issue. This is a  national issue, it&rsquo;s a national issue . It&rsquo;s a crisis that we have to come  together to work on. That&rsquo;s in the first six years. If you take 2015&rsquo;s numbers,  it&rsquo;s probably north of 18,000.</p>
<p>Too  many family members here‚Ä¶ Christina is lucky to be here, lucky to survive. Too  many families here who weren&rsquo;t so lucky. Their children didn&rsquo;t survive. It&rsquo;s a  tragedy that no family should have to go through. Father Mike (Pfleger) has had  to bury too many young people who, through no fault of their own, their lives  were taken from them. There is a group Purpose Over Pain. Can we ask those  parents to please stand?</p>
<p>My  wife and I have two children. I can&rsquo;t imagine what you&rsquo;ve had to go through.  Whatever we can do to support you going forward, just know that we are going to  be in it for the long haul and how much we appreciate you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Let  me give you one more number‚Äî5 million. That&rsquo;s the number of young people who  dropped out of high school over the past 6-7 years. 5 milllion across the  country. That&rsquo;s even with high school graduation rates at all-time highs and  dropout rates at all-time lows. 5 million young people, ages 15-25, today, who  are out there who walked away from our schools, on the streets, very little  hope. To me, these two populations‚Äîthose we have lost and those we are  losing‚Äîthey&rsquo;re so similar. They are losing hope and facing similar challenges.  These issues are absolutely interrelated, they&rsquo;re absolutely connected. Too  many of these kids, we have lost them almost from the very start. They are  behind at birth. You never catch them up. They got passed along too easily  through schools, through grades, through communities, through foster care  systems. But their needs for love, support, opportunity, physical and  psychological safety‚Äîtheir needs were rarely met. </p>
<p>What  does this collective failure as adults to nurture and protect our children  mean? What impact does it have on them, both psychologically and on the decisions  that they make.</p>
<p>Let  me give you a couple of quick examples. When I ran Chicago Public Schools here,  I kept a picture above my desk that a young man gave me when I visited his  school. It was a picture of a fire fighter climbing a ladder.¬† The caption he wrote on it was &ldquo;If I grow up,  I want to be a fireman.&rdquo; If I grow up, not when. That&rsquo;s what he was thinking.  That was his reality. </p>
<p>When  I visited Ferguson (Missouri) after the unrest there, talked to an amazing  young girl who said she considered it a blessing if I can live to be 16. </p>
<p>Was  in Baltimore a couple of weeks ago, been there a couple of time, talked to an  amazing junior in high school, a young woman there who talked about the  challenges her young male friends were having. She said so many of her young  friends don&rsquo;t think they will live past 23. I asked her what percent of your  friends don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to live past 23? She thought for a moment and  said 60 percent. I don&rsquo;t know if she is right. I don&rsquo;t know if she is wrong.  But just half of that number, half that number. Think what it means for our  young people. We are talking about going to college, planning for the future, deferring  gratification. Think if 60 percent of young people that she knows in Baltimore  honestly don&rsquo;t believe in their hearts that they are going to live past 23,  what does that do to their decision-making process? What does that make them  think about every single day? And that is their reality. </p>
<p>I  think we as adults, we have not come to grips with the reality what our kids  are feeling, saying, articulating to us. I almost think it&rsquo;s too hard, too  painful for us to fully come to grips with that of young people, &ldquo;if&rdquo; I grow  up, not &ldquo;when.&rdquo; The majority of young men of color don&rsquo;t think they will live  past 23. What does that compel us to do? It&rsquo;s not business as usual. It&rsquo;s  something radically, radically different.</p>
<p>Like  the President, I feel there has been no greater frustration, no greater  disappointment than Congress&rsquo; unwillingness to move the most simple, most basic  laws to better protect our children. There&rsquo;s not a greater disconnect in public  policy between what the American public wants in terms of preventing gun  violence, increasing safety, and what Congress has actually done. <br />
  It  doesn&rsquo;t mean that we should quit, doesn&rsquo;t mean we should give up. I guarantee  you that I am in this for the long haul. I guarantee that the President will do  everything he can in his power over the course of the next year. The fact that  we as a nation have allowed so many of our young people to die, somehow it has  become an acceptable way of life. There aren&rsquo;t too many other places.</p>
<p>My  wife grew up in Australia. Grew up in the state of Tasmania. In 1996, they had  an awful shooting, a massacre. A couple 35 people killed and dozens injured.  And a couple of weeks after that, Australia radically changed their gun laws.  Over the past 18-19 years, there has not been one, not a single mass shooting  in the country of Australia. They have mental illness, they have challenges, they  have angry young men. Not one.</p>
<p>We  as a nation, this is almost a weekly occurrence now that this is happening.  Same issues, same challenges, different response, radically different results.  An entire generation of young people don&rsquo;t know what a mass shooting is in  Australia. That&rsquo;s history. Look at the gift that country has given to their  children, versus what we have done here in the United States. </p>
<p>We  can&rsquo;t let up. We have to break through. We have to get guns out of the wrong  people&rsquo;s hands. We have to make our babies safe. We have to make sure that  these things don&rsquo;t just continue. So the fact that we haven&rsquo;t broken through is  by far our greatest frustration, but it&rsquo;s not a reason to ever stop, and we  have to continue to work to do more there. </p>
<p>And  today, I don&rsquo;t want to just talk about the physical and psychological safety  related to guns. It&rsquo;s just the reality we have to talk about - we have to  address the issue of police training and conduct, as well. </p>
<p>Whether  it&rsquo;s right here in Chicago; whether it&rsquo;s Ferguson, or it&rsquo;s Baltimore, or it&rsquo;s  Cleveland, or countless other communities, these issues are real. And to turn a  blind eye, to not address them, I think would be much less than honest.</p>
<p>Today,  we have good cops who feel they do not have a chance. When cops unnecessarily  use deadly force and aren&rsquo;t held accountable, and when other cops witness that  behavior and lie about it and they aren&rsquo;t held accountable, then the system  loses its most precious resource‚Äîand that&rsquo;s the public&rsquo;s trust. I talked to a  policeman who is a friend the other day. Policemen have the hardest job. It&rsquo;s  unimaginable how hard their jobs are. And, most police do more good in a week  than many of us do in a year. We have to support the ones who are doing the  right thing. I talked to a cop I have tremendous respect for on Monday. He said  the change he feels they need in the culture isn&rsquo;t incremental. The word he  used was seismic, they need seismic change. I think he&rsquo;s right. I think gaining  the public&rsquo;s trust is never easy, but it can be done. In situations like this,  actions always speak much louder than words. It&rsquo;s not just training that they  need. There has to be a commitment to truth and transparency, and not  protecting the bad apples. So, there&rsquo;s an urgent need there.</p>
<p>I  want to add something that&rsquo;s a hard thing to say today, but again it&rsquo;s the  truth and I want to be as truthful as I can. That both we as a nation and as a  city ‚Äì I want to be very, very clear ‚Äì if we were to fix every police  department today in need of help, in need of change ‚Äì if we were able to do  that ‚Äì that would be great. But if we don&rsquo;t fix the communities where so many  of our children are dying, if we don&rsquo;t address the underlying causes why so  many children are dying and so many are dropping out, then we cannot begin to  declare victory.</p>
<p>This  is where I think Father Pfleger&rsquo;s passion and vision is so important. We must  ask so much more of ourselves at a time of real crisis. We have to honestly  address everything ‚Äì address the big picture. This is a time ‚Äì if ever there  was one ‚Äì where we have to challenge everything ‚Äì to think big and to think  long term. The truth is that in virtually every community plagued by devastating  levels of violence, you will also find a perfect storm of high unemployment,  under-resourced schools, little economic development, high percentage of people  returning from prison, and few ‚Äì if any - positive options for the children we  care so much about. What&rsquo;s harming our children is not just gun violence. It&rsquo;s  the hopelessness. It&rsquo;s the lack of hope and the disconnectedness that leads  children to pick up those guns when they have challenges.</p>
<p>And  simply put, if we want to change kids&rsquo; lives and not just keep them alive, we  must put in place what I&rsquo;m going to call a &ldquo;new deal.&rdquo; A new deal for children  and a new vision for the communities in which they live. Our children need hope  and hope not in the unseen or the distance, but in what they can see every day  on their block and in their schools and in their communities.</p>
<p>And  let me close with four ideas that I&rsquo;m convinced would both transform our  children&rsquo;s opportunity structure and, just as importantly, help them believe  that they have a future ‚Äì that there is a reason to work hard and do the right  thing, to think long term and not just try and survive. </p>
<p>First,  and this is not a new issue, I&rsquo;ve talked about this all over the country. I&rsquo;m  huge believe in the power of early childhood education. And in those  communities that have‚Äîin those communities plagued by devastating levels of  violence, we have to make sure that every baby has a chance to get off to  school and be prepared to enter kindergarten and be successful. And the fact is  that today, the average child coming from a poor community starts kindergarten  at five-years-old 14 to 16 months behind. And the honest truth is that we as  adults rarely do a good job of catching them back up. Those students that start  behind, you can draw direct line from starting behind to future dropping out to  future incarceration. If we were to address it at the front end, we could do so  much to give children a chance.</p>
<p>Recently I had a friend who actually grew up here in  Chicago, lives in DC now. His family moved to Minneapolis, and tragically his  brother was killed just a couple of weeks ago. And I called the two people that  I&rsquo;m closest to in Minneapolis to try and help figure out the situation there.  One is a woman named Laysha Ward, who runs Target&rsquo;s foundation there, and the  other woman is Brenda <em>Cassellius</em>,  who&rsquo;s the chief state school officer for the state of Minnesota. Both those  women happen to be African American. Both of them&nbsp;happen to be products of  the Head Start systems themselves, when they were kids.&nbsp; These are  powerful women who had a chance, they weren&rsquo;t born with a silver spoon in their  mouths, but because they had Head Start and because they had other things, they  are now powerful community leaders. </p>
<p>We have some many other babies out there who could  do so much if we just gave them a chance.&nbsp;We have to commit, not to every  child but for those children in the communities. Take in Chicago, in DC, in  Baltimore, those five communities, those 10 communities with the highest levels  of violence.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s figure out in a laser-like, intensive way how we put  these things in place for the communities that are hurting the most and need  the most help.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have to realize that teaching in Englewood  and teaching in North Lawndale and being a counselor and social worker is a  very different job than being a teacher, counselor or social worker on the Gold  Coast, or at Northside College Prep.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  We as a nation have failed to recognize and reward  the degree of difficulty that goes into this work. And, I presented an idea a  couple of months ago at the National Press Club, let me just sort of walk it  through very quickly for you.&nbsp; Talked about the school-to-prison pipeline  and how when you have zero tolerance policies and when you start to suspend and  expel ‚Äì 4 and 5-year-olds, 3-year olds, in pre-K, we have to look in the mirror  and say we are perpetuating the school-to-prison pipeline.&nbsp; We are part of  the problem as educators and we have to face that.</p>
<p>As we address that, that leaves the mass  incarceration, which has been a disaster for the nation, for our communities  and for our families. If we simply stop locking up 50 percent of our nonviolent  offenders, that would free $15 billion each year, $15 billion dollars could  give a 50 percent bonus to every teacher, principal, social worker and  counselor who work in our highest poverty schools.</p>
<p>And I promise you if we invested, if we brought the  hardest working and most committed educators into the communities who need the  most help, the difference for our children would be extraordinary.</p>
<p>Third, not every child, but so many of our kids need  a mentor. They need a role model, and I can&rsquo;t overstate the power of  relationships. Every single one of us is in this room because we had someone, a  teacher, a counselor, a coach, a parent or grandparent, someone who saw  something in us that we didn&rsquo;t see in ourselves and helped to move us forward. Not every child  needs that, some child is lucky enough to have a strong mom or a strong dad or  both or a grandmom.¬† We have too many  kids that don&rsquo;t have any of those and those are the kids that fall through the  cracks.¬† And if we committed not at 13,  14 or 15 or 16 in high school but in kindergarten or first grade to those  children and gave them the long-term support they needed‚Äîthat is a life-transforming,  life-altering process.¬†¬† </p>
<p>How  do we find out? Talk to those pre-K teachers, talk to those kindergarten  teachers.¬† They know.¬† When I was in Baltimore recently, I talked to  a first-grade teacher.¬† She has about 28  kids in her class.¬† I said how many more  need more than what they are getting every single day.She thought for a minute  and went through her head.¬† Nine, she&rsquo;s  got nine.¬† </p>
<p>And  where are we as a nation, not as a school system, as churches, as non-profits,  as social service agencies‚Äîare we asking those teachers in pre-K, in K, in  first-grade, in our most devastated communities‚Äîwhich kids need more help? And  are we willing to stay with them for the long-haul? And if we did that, if we  did that, we could counter some of the destructive behavior happening sometimes  at homes and in the community. The difference it would make for our young  people is unbelievable. </p>
<p>There  is a young woman‚Äîis LaWanda here? LaWanda Crayton?¬† I don&rsquo;t know if she came. LaWanda, stand up. LaWanda  and I have talked about this publicly. ¬†I  recently interviewed her for a StoryCorps interview. So you can read her story,  she has been very, very open and honest about this. But LaWanda is a part of  the &ldquo;I have A Dream Program&rdquo; that my sister and I started back in &rsquo;91, &rsquo;92. I&rsquo;m  not going to say anything LaWanda hasn&rsquo;t said herself. You don&rsquo;t have to keep  standing. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Lawanda  came from a situation, living with her mom and her stepfather that was not  dysfunctional ‚Äì it was violent. And there was a level of violence that was  staggering. And the number of times the police were coming to her home was  unbelievable. </p>
<p>There  was a time when Lawanda didn&rsquo;t want to live anymore. There was a time when her  sister tried to commit suicide. There was a time when LaWanda got tied to the  gangs a little bit in the neighborhood. But LaWanda had an amazing mentor named  Carlene Theodore. She had my sister and me, and Chris and Kendall Mallette and  Bill Jordan in her life. And for all of those negative and destructive forces,  she was this amazing leader and bright young woman. And we were able to  counteract some of that stuff.</p>
<p>And  today she&rsquo;s doing an amazing job working with the city as a leader here. She&rsquo;s an  amazing mother, and her two girls are having a radically different life than  what she and her sister had growing up. What gives me the greatest joy is that  she is now mentoring other young people and helping them. So in one generation,  you went from absolute violence, absolute chaos, absolute self-destruction, to  a city leader and a role model and an amazing mom and a mentor. That&rsquo;s the  power of relationships.</p>
<p>In  a time when technology is very important¬†  - I understand that. But I&rsquo;ve never seen a phone change a person&rsquo;s life.  It&rsquo;s relationships. It&rsquo;s people who care about you. It&rsquo;s people who are going  to be with you through good times and bad. There are other LaWandas out there,  Southside, Westside, all across the nation, who have this amazing potential.  But if we don&rsquo;t intervene, and intervene early, they are going to go the wrong  way because there is no other choice. There is no other option. And so we have  to break through there.</p>
<p>And  then finally, we have to talk about the economic situation ‚Äì the economic  injustice, and jobs, and job creation, and support of ownership, and support of  minority businesses. And if we don&rsquo;t have real jobs and real opportunities for  young people, then far too many have no choice but to go to the streets. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve  yet to hear of a gang that says that they&rsquo;re not hiring. Rain, shine, sleet,  snow, they&rsquo;re out there. And when we&rsquo;re going about our business and we&rsquo;re home  comfortably in our homes at night, those children who are desperate ‚Äì those children  who are falling through the cracks ‚Äì they have one choice. They have one  choice, and we have to provide other options. </p>
<p>We  have so many kids who are defying the odds every single day: Honor roll  students; 98, 99, 100 percent attendance. What do we do as a city‚Äì not just as  a city, but as a nation ‚Äì what do we do to guarantee them a job and a chance to  build upon their skills and to have a future? We don&rsquo;t. We don&rsquo;t provide those  rewards. We don&rsquo;t provide those incentives. And if they get desperate for  money, there&rsquo;s one place to look. </p>
<p>Father  Pfleger and I went a couple months ago to meet with a bunch of young men who  are locked up here in town. And it was stunning to me, out of a room of 10 or  12 young men, two or three of them basically said, &ldquo;We just got tired of seeing  our mothers cry at night. We got tired of their pain. And we had to go do what  we needed to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  I sort of asked the question, &ldquo;Did you have a mentor? Did you have a role  model? Did you have a chance to earn money in the legal economy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  they almost couldn&rsquo;t comprehend the question. It was so far ‚Äì so distant from  their reality. No one was close. So it wasn&rsquo;t that they were bad kids ‚Äì wasn&rsquo;t  that they were evil. They did not see an option. They were hungry. Their  mothers were struggling. They had one option ‚Äì one availability ‚Äì in their  neighborhood. And we as a community of adults haven&rsquo;t come together to  counteract that. </p>
<p>I  want to talk about not just jobs and job creation, but the importance of  minority entrepreneurs and ownership, and what that can mean in our  communities. Minority entrepreneurs are from the community. They&rsquo;re committed  to the community. They don&rsquo;t just create jobs, they also give  philanthropically. They&rsquo;re generous. And they support other minority businesses.  So you have these ripple effects ‚Äì deepening effects ‚Äì that help more  businesses grow. </p>
<p>And  it kills me that in a place like Chicago, we don&rsquo;t know our history. We don&rsquo;t  remember our history. It&rsquo;s not even that ancient. People like Ed Gardner, an amazing  business leader, but he funded Black on Black Love. He helped fund the new  Regal Theater. He helped to elect our city&rsquo;s first black mayor, Harold  Washington. He employed hundreds and hundreds of folks. </p>
<p>George  Johnson. He chaired the Independence Bank ‚Äì largest black-owned bank. He was  the biggest customer ‚Äì advertised on Soul Train. He was one of the biggest  customers of Essence and Ebony and kept those businesses going. He was the  biggest customer of Burrell Advertising, which is the largest black advertising  company in the nation. And when Dr. King couldn&rsquo;t make payroll for the SCLC,  who did he go to? He went to George Johnson. </p>
<p>We  can&rsquo;t have social movements, if we don&rsquo;t have commerce, if we don&rsquo;t have  business.¬† If you go today in a city like  Chicago, that is majority-minority‚ÄîCrain&rsquo;s just came out with this 2016 book of  lists. You can go check it out.¬† I may be  wrong but I don&rsquo;t think I am, you can look at it. A city that is majority-minority  like Chicago, if you look at the 150 largest businesses in our city‚Äîhow many  are black-owned?¬† None.¬† None.¬†  Not one.¬† And again, you have to  draw a direct line for children&rsquo;s hopelessness and picking up guns to the lack  of positive economic opportunities. And if we don&rsquo;t support our business  community and the minority community; if we don&rsquo;t create jobs and  sustainability‚Äîwe cannot solve these social problems in isolation.¬† </p>
<p>These  challenges are all real and they&rsquo;re urgent in many places, including Chicago.  Chicago is not unique but including Chicago. I think we&rsquo;re at a crisis point, a  crisis level. </p>
<p>But  for all of that, I want to say how hopeful I am and how optimistic I am. We can  turn the pain and the fear and the anger and the heartbreak into unprecedented  action.¬† Not talk, not soundbytes, but  action.¬† Here in Chicago and across the  nation, amazing things can happen.¬† </p>
<p>And  let me just close quickly with why I am hopeful with these examples locally and  nationally and internationally where these things are absolutely  happening.¬† Everywhere I am talking  about, this is not about hoping for the unseen. We see it in cities like New  York and San Antonio have committed to things like early childhood education at  scale.¬† </p>
<p>I  was in the Netherlands for a couple of days this summer.¬† In the Netherlands, every four-year-old,  every four-year-old has access to pre-K. They are now moving to every  three-year-old.¬† And the question they  ask me is why in America, don&rsquo;t you guys care about your children more?¬† </p>
<p>This  can happen. In terms of great teachers, and trying to move great teachers and  principals and support them in under-served communities.¬† Charlotte-Mecklenburg is systemically in  North Carolina, identifying their best talent and putting that in communities  that have been hardest hit.¬† I visited  there and I spoke with the principal.¬† He  had been there for 25-30 years and thinking of retiring.¬† Had been at a more affluent school, was asked  by the district to move to one of the poorer areas and work there.¬† He thought about retiring.¬† He decided to do the work. He said, &ldquo;Arne  this is the most moral and ethical work that I have done in my life and I am so  thankful for the privilege of having this opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>South  Korea, which beats us on every metric in terms of educational opportunity‚Äîthey  pay teachers more and support them to work in underserved communities.¬† These things can be done. </p>
<p>Mentoring,  in places like St. Sabina, they are doing an amazing job of helping young men  who are struggling with their past, come back to the community, turn their  lives around and help others do it.¬† </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve  visited the Match Tutoring program in Bogan High School doing a fantastic job  not just in academic support but at helping kids be successful, putting adults  in their lives who matter.¬† Jobs. After  School Matters hires 10,000 young people here across Chicago. The University of  Chicago does an amazing job as an anchor institution of supporting minority  entrepreneurs and bringing businesses to the community. </p>
<p>I  visited Carrollton, Georgia, on one of my back-to-school bus tours‚Äîrural, poor  and largely white. Met with a group of young people who are going to be first  from their families to graduate from high school.¬† Not from college, but high school. One young  girl had a baby at 15. And another, both of her parents had been in to school  for drug addiction. And another young boy, his mother was on her third  husband‚Äîthat husband had kicked him out. And what they have done there with a  private company, a company called Southwire, is the kids go to school half the  day in the mornings and they work in the Southwire plant in the  afternoons.¬† And they don&rsquo;t work in the  plant, they run the plant.¬† They are the  tech support, they literally run the plant. They are the CEO. They set the  hours. And I met with the folks from Southwire, I had never seen anything like  this before. This was not a charity.¬† He  said, the guy was very clear, this was not philanthropy.¬† This was a business. We&rsquo;re making a profit  here.¬† </p>
<p>And  young people who are at the bottom of the barrel, who had every risk factor  imaginable were the leaders in this community‚Äîhelping to create jobs, helping  to make money to support themselves and go on to college.¬† So all these things are possible.¬† </p>
<p>What  we need in Chicago and in Baltimore and in Cleveland and in so many urban centers.  Yes, we need some ideas, but honestly this is not rocket science. This is not  looking for the next cure for cancer. A simple question, I will close here. Do  we have the will, do we have the courage, do we have the ability to think at  scale? Not in terms of pilot programs but do we have the ability to think  comprehensively, not one piece but to take the whole thing together? And are we  willing to think long-term?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re  going into a new year, 2016. What if we had a 10-year plan to do something  radically different at 79th and Ashland and in Englewood and in North Lawndale?  What if a handful of communities here in urban Chicago and other cities, we  said, at scale, every child would have access to early childhood and to great  teachers and to principals and to after-school programs and to mentors and to  jobs?</p>
<p>If  we did that, I promise you we would have a lot more LaWanda Craytons, a lot  more Christina Waters, a lot more young people who have this amazing talent. In  our nation, talent is much more evenly distributed than opportunity. And if we  adults commit to delivering opportunity fairly and openly, our kids will do  very well. </p>
<p>Thank  you so much, happy to take your questions.</p></div></div></div>  </div>
