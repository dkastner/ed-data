 <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-acting-us-secretary-education-john-b-king-jr</link>
 <description>Good afternoon.  I&#039;m John King, Acting U.S. Secretary of Education. It&#039;s wonderful to be here today. What an amazing place this is—it&#039;s incredible to think that this was once an abandoned rec center in downtown Baltimore. Today, the Digital Harbor Foundation Tech Center is a public makerspace, with a focus on giving disadvantaged youth the resources and the tools to tinker, create and learn.  It&#039;s a place where kids can be kids—and also scientists, builders, engineers and coders. This is the future of play and also of work.</description>

Thank you, Reverend Sharpton.

I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s more daunting to follow you at the podium, or to precede the Attorney General. I do know that I&#039;m glad to be part of this formidable gathering, and grateful to you, Reverend Sharpton, for your leadership.</description>

 <description>Thank  you so much. It’s good to be home. I will say a couple of things before I  start. First off, Christina (Waters). I met her, I recall meeting her when she  was in the hospital fighting for her life. She had gone through elementary  school to Ariel Community Academy. Great student. Fantastic basketball player. (Inaudible).  Was going in a couple of days to college to compete. Was at a church social and  was shot there in the head. Don’t know why. Don’t know by whom. Somehow through  that tragedy, she has gone on to do amazing things.</description>

 <description>Thank you so much. I think all that applause might be for the last speech part of what she said so. I’m honored to be here. It might not quite be my last speech and I’ll keep it pretty brief. I look forward to having a great conversation with you and I want to have a policy conversation but start it and end it rounded with a couple stories about kids and one of the biggest joys of my job is being able to travel the nation, visit hundreds and hundreds of schools and many adults, many of you in the room have inspired me every single day.</description>
