To our graduates, and to their families who have supported them on this journey,  congratulations.</p>

<p>Although  I am so pleased to be here today, this occasion is a humbling one too. I know  the rich history here--and we need Howard, and all HBCUs, not just to survive  but to thrive as we move forward.</p>

<p>For  the past 145 years—ever since Howard University was created by an act of  Congress signed by President Andrew Johnson himself—Howard, and its proud  graduates and its star faculty, have been a barometer on the state of the  American Dream.</p>

<p>In  1965, President Lyndon Johnson gave a famous commencement speech here at Howard  where he said that the &ldquo;graduating class at Howard University is witness to the  indomitable determination of the [black] American to win his way in American  life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every  American, he said, should be able to become whatever their &ldquo;qualities of mind  and spirit would permit—to strive, to seek, and to find happiness. This is  American justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sixteen years later, Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s vice-president, George H.W. Bush, stood on this  commencement stage. He called Howard a &ldquo;crucible for ideas and social action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jump  forward 17 years to 1998, and my colleague and friend, Hillary Clinton was the commencement  speaker and the First Lady. She said that it was &ldquo;impossible for anyone to come  to this campus . . . and not feel the richness of Howard&rsquo;s tradition . . . and  a reverence for those who paved the way for tomorrow&rsquo;s leaders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So  I stand here today in the shadows of giants. I stand here fully aware that  Howard has been, yes, a crucible for social action and a proving ground for American justice.</p>

<p>And  I am humbled to be sharing the stage with such a distinguished group of  honorary degree recipients. Chris Mathews, and my good friends John Legend and Julieanna Richardson, are all ground-breakers in their professions. They are passionate believers in equal opportunity and the power of a great education.</p>

<p>And  Isabel Wilkerson, a Howard alumnus who had a storied career with the <em>New York Times, </em>is the first black woman  in the history of American journalism to win a Pulitzer Prize. <em>The Warmth of Other Suns, </em>her epic  history of the black migration, is without parallel.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s  mighty impressive company. But to the honorary degree recipients, I just want to say—please, don&rsquo;t let it go to your head.</p>

<p>Previous  honorary degree recipients at Howard include Frederick Douglass, Marian  Anderson, Eleanor Roosevelt, James Baldwin, and Desmond Tutu.</p>

<p>In  1957, two of my heroes, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jackie Robinson,  were both honorary degree recipients. Can you imagine that extraordinary occasion?</p>

<p>I  know that it may seem hard for today&rsquo;s graduates to envision their peers 15 to  20 years from now. When I graduated, it never occurred to me that I might one  day serve as the Secretary of Education. I had what I thought was a more  sensible plan. I was going to play in the NBA. Clearly, that didn&rsquo;t work out!</p>

<p>But  if you look to your left and your right today, if you look in front and behind  you, you will see America&rsquo;s future leaders.</p>

<p>Few  universities can claim as many firsts as Howard. Toni Morrison, a Howard  graduate and former member of the faculty, was the first black woman to receive  both the Nobel Prize and Pulitzer Prize in literature.</p>

<p>Your  university Provost, Dr. Lasalle Leffall, is the first African-American  president of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society.</p>

<p>Other  Howard graduates were the first African-Americans to be elected to the U.S. Senate, a U.S. governor, mayor of New York City, and U.N. Ambassador. </p>

<p>And  last, but certainly not least, the mighty Thurgood Marshall, the first  African-American Supreme Court Justice, was in Howard&rsquo;s Law School first  graduating class.</p>

<p>I  have said repeatedly that education is the civil rights issue of our generation. And few can testify to that truth more powerfully than the founders  of Howard and their successors here today. </p>

<p>There  is a reason, as President Obama says, &ldquo;that the story of the civil rights  movement was written in our schools.&rdquo; That reason is known to everyone here  today. Education is the great equalizer in America.</p>

<p>It  doesn&rsquo;t matter what your race, income, or zip code is—every child is entitled  to a quality education. And this fight is about so much more than educational  opportunity—it is a fight for social justice. As Lyndon Johnson said at Howard many years ago, this is a fight for &ldquo;American justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Howard&rsquo;s  leaders and students have always understood this. No institution has done more  to tear down the barriers of segregation. </p>

<p>When Howard Law School opened, its faculty created a course to train law students in  how to challenge Jim Crow laws in court.</p>

<p>Soon  after leaving Howard, Thurgood Marshall became the NAACP&rsquo;s chief counsel. And nine of the ten NAACP lawyers who worked  on the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case under Marshall were Howard Law  graduates. Marshall argued the case before the Supreme Court and won—and  changed the course of American history forever.</p>

<p>When I was the CEO of the Chicago Public Schools, I loved sending our students to  Howard. I knew they would get a great  education, and be cared for in a community that nurtured leadership, commitment,  and compassion.</p>

<p>One  of my students was De&rsquo;Rell Bonner, who served on my student advisory council.  He and his peers told me the truth—what I needed to hear, not what I wanted to hear. And in doing so, they made the system better.</p>

<p>In  Chicago, De&rsquo;Rell helped organize a rally to improve Chicago&rsquo;s public schools  and addressed a crowd of more than 25,000 people. In Washington, and at Howard,  De&rsquo;Rell continues to treat democracy as a verb. He knows that protecting our  democracy requires action, not just admiring.</p>

<p>Like  many of you, De&rsquo;Rell is the first in his family to go to college. He came to Howard and to Washington right around the same time that I did.</p>

<p>Both  the President and I are hoping to stay on in DC for four more years. And I hope De&rsquo;Rell considers sticking around as well. In fact, he&rsquo;ll be interning with me this summer.</p>

<p>I  have confidence in De&rsquo;Rell, and in all of you, because you don&rsquo;t get through  Howard without hard work—and without overcoming challenges. </p>

<p>You  had to overcome Bison-web and override slips. You survived the Snowmaggedon blizzard  of 2010. After 14 years of waiting, the football team beat Hampton. And Morehouse. The Lady Bison went all the way to the final of the MEAC basketball tournament  this year.</p>

<p>One  campus acappella group, Afro-Blue, made it all the way to the finals of &ldquo;The  Sing Off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But  Afro-Blue is so much more than a group of amazing voices with sophisticated arrangements;  they combine excellence with commitment. As Howard ambassadors, they also sang vocal jazz to raise money to alleviate famine and malnutrition in Somalia.</p>

<p>At  Howard, Afro-Blue&rsquo;s commitment to social justice is widely shared. Nearly 400 Howard  students volunteered in the alternative spring break program in five cities  this year. You raised over $80,000 to support service in five communities. You  slept on the floors of churches and shelters to tackle the tough issues, like devastating  gun violence in my hometown of Chicago and devastating illiteracy in Detroit.</p>

<p>Howard  students have a long history of doing what they think is right--and not just what  they are told. You insist on fighting inequity—from creating the viral video  campaign &ldquo;Am I Suspicious&rdquo; to counteract the racial profiling of Trayvon Martin  in his hoodie, to challenging campus policies. </p>

<p>Now,  when I give commencement speeches, I know that I am really speaking to two audiences. The graduates want a short speech so they can get to celebrating.</p>

<p>But  your parents, your aunts, uncles, and grandparents, and your professors,  they&rsquo;re not in such a rush. They say, &ldquo;Unh-unh. Not so fast, Mr. Secretary. I&rsquo;ve  been waiting a long time for this day. We bought this lunch. Take your time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And  since tomorrow is Mother&rsquo;s day, I&rsquo;m going to listen to the mothers and aunts  and grandmas in the audience and just talk for a few more minutes here.</p>

<p>Seeing  your child in a cap and gown, earning a Howard degree—that&rsquo;s about the best  Mother&rsquo;s Day gift I can imagine.</p>

<p>If  I can leave you with two messages today, the first would be to pursue your  passion in the years ahead. Experience the life-altering opportunity to find  what you love--and stick with it, even if it may take you down some unexpected  or unconventional paths.</p>

<p>The  second piece of advice that I would pass on is to continue the powerful Howard  tradition of giving something back, of paying it forward.  When Marian Wright Edelman gave the Howard  commencement in 1990, she said that &ldquo;service is the rent each of us pays for  living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Your  goal in life can&rsquo;t just be to do well for yourself. I love Howard&rsquo;s motto,  &ldquo;Truth and Service.&rdquo; Not &ldquo;Truth <em>or </em>Service.&rdquo;  Truth <em>and </em>Service. As Dr. King said,  &ldquo;Everybody can be great, because anybody can serve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I  know that giving back is easier to preach than practice. Many of you have  student loans to pay off. And you&rsquo;re concerned about the tough job market. It&rsquo;s  hard to take a more rewarding job that pays less, or to think about giving back,  when you have loans to pay back. </p>

<p>But  despite those very real challenges, life will ultimately be richer and more rewarding if you pursue a passion in your career. Believe in your talent and  you can accomplish the unexpected. </p>

<p>Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said that if you take a job that you love, you will  &ldquo;jump out of bed in the morning.&rdquo; So, don&rsquo;t wait for your old age to do what  you love. Don&rsquo;t look back and say &ldquo;I wish I had done it different or sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve  always had two loves: basketball and education. In 25 years, those are the only  jobs I&rsquo;ve ever had. And though my career followed an unconventional path because I didn&rsquo;t make the Boston Celtics and ended up playing ball in Australia, that&rsquo;s  where I met my wife.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s  funny how things turn out. We are blessed with two wonderful children, a  ten-year old daughter and eight-year old son. I&rsquo;ve had friends make a lot more  money than me, but I&rsquo;ve been so lucky to get up every day, and do something I care passionately about--I wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing.</p>

<p>So, when you leave here, run for office, volunteer at a local school, or coach a  team—even if it sometimes seems the tougher path to take.</p>

<p>Find  what you love, find your genius. Find what would you get up and do every day,  even if you weren&rsquo;t getting a paycheck. And whatever that calling is, pursue it  with all your heart.</p>

<p>I  recognize, of course, that getting a job is important. It&rsquo;s a big and necessary step. But it&rsquo;s every bit as important to be an informed and engaged citizen.</p>

<p>President  Obama&rsquo;s election four years ago showed that America has come a long way as a  nation. Yet we still have a long way to go to fulfill Dr. King&rsquo;s dream and the  American promise. We&rsquo;re not in a post-racial America, not yet.</p>

<p>We will be closer to fulfilling that dream when more black and brown children enter kindergarten ready to read.</p>

<p>We will have arrived when more children have fathers that are actively engaged in their lives.</p>

<p>We will have arrived when more black men by their mid-thirties have college degrees and not criminal records.</p>

<p>We  will have arrived when our schools are less segregated and racially isolated  than when Dr. King was assassinated--instead of more segregated, as they are  today.</p>

<p>And  we will have arrived when an innocent black teenager in a hoodie is not somehow  a criminal suspect.</p>

<p>The  truth is that in the years ahead, American will desperately need your  leadership. There are so many battles you must help fight and win.</p>

<p>The  poll tax and literacy tests once used to bar blacks from voting may be gone.  But just since the beginning of 2011, 17 states—one third of the states—have  passed laws that restrict the right to vote.</p>

<p>Most  of these new laws require citizens to show a government-issued photo ID before  being allowed to cast a ballot. It&rsquo;s no secret that the sponsors of these laws  know that black and Hispanic voters are overrepresented among citizens without  a government-issued photo ID. How was this allowed to happen?</p>

<p>Our  nation is similarly engaged in a great debate about education now. It is not a  theoretical or academic debate. It is a debate that will have a big impact on  the future of Pell Grant scholarships and student loans.</p>

<p>President  Obama and I both believe that education is a public good. College should not be  reserved only for those who can afford it. In fact, investing in education is  the best investment America can make to bolster our competitiveness in a  knowledge-based, global economy. If we don&rsquo;t invest today, we will lose  tomorrow.</p>

<p>Yet,  we know that not everyone in Congress agrees. Some see student aid for  middle-class and working and poor families as an expense that should be cut back  in tight times, not as an investment in the future. One recent presidential candidate  even called President Obama a snob for wanting more folks to go to college.  </p>


<p>Getting  an education isn&rsquo;t snobbery—it&rsquo;s the ultimate act of self-empowerment.</p>
<p>The  pursuit of knowledge is a sacred journey that people have literally died for. There  was a time in this country&rsquo;s history when you could be whipped and beaten for  teaching a slave to read.</p>

<p>Why  was that? Because knowledge is power—and while you can lose many things in  life, an education can never be taken away from you.</p>

<p>When  I look out at all of you today, I don&rsquo;t see snobs. I see students and families  who worked hard and sacrificed and saved to send their children to Howard.</p>

<p>I  see mothers and fathers with sons and daughters who will be the first in their  family to graduate from college.</p>

<p>And  I see committed students who achieved their dreams of earning a Howard degree  with the help of Pell Grants and federal student loans.</p>

<p>Zora  Neale Hurston, one of America&rsquo;s greatest writers and a Howard alumnus, beautifully  captured the power of a college education when she described what it was like  for her to hear Howard&rsquo;s alma mater sung.</p>

<p>She  said: &ldquo;My soul stood on tip toe and stretched up to take in all that it meant .  . . [I wanted to] be worthy to stand there under the shadow of the hovering  spirit of Howard. I felt the ladder beneath my feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I  felt the ladder beneath my feet . . . Yes, she felt the sturdy rungs of the  ladder built by those who came before her. She understood that education was a  climb--one she couldn&rsquo;t have made without those who preceded her and whose  memory she honored.</p>

<p>As  you leave Howard, I hope you will always feel the ladder beneath your feet.  There&rsquo;s more than one way to thank those who came before you--and to give back  to those who will climb that ladder after you.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t  take my word for it. Ask your fellow Howard students who are graduating today.</p>

<p>Ask  Victoria Fortune, who, after the earthquake in Haiti, organized a benefit  concert at Howard that raised more than $17,000 for the relief effort--and then  took a trip to Haiti to help on the ground in two orphanages.</p>

<p>Ask  April Vance, who started a non-profit that provides much-needed mentors for  middle school and high school students in foster care. More than 160 students  in the DC area are now enrolled in her program.</p>

<p>Ask  chemical engineering major Shorma Bianca Bailey. The White House picked Shorma  as a champion of change for encouraging more women and girls to go into  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Shorma is now president of  the Howard Chapter of Engineers Without Borders.</p>

<p>I  hope that many of you will leave here today thinking about how you can  strengthen our education system, especially for children of color.</p>

<p>There  are so many ways to give back—teach, become a principal, tutor, mentor  children, shape policy, and become an advocate.</p>

<p>Ask  Michael Powell, who got his masters degree at Howard&rsquo;s School of Education.</p>

<p>When  Michael graduated from college he became a DC firefighter. But he came from a  family where you were either a &ldquo;preacher or a teacher&rdquo;--and before long he felt  the call of the classroom.</p>

<p>Michael  went on to win an Outstanding Young Educators award for his work as the  Assistant Principal at Patuxent Elementary School in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.</p>

<p>He  won that national award because he worked tirelessly to help the whole child. He  created the No Child Left Inside program to excite children&rsquo;s interest in  environmental science. His students have planted more than 1,500 trees and  maintained historic trails.</p>

<p>He  didn&rsquo;t stop there. He created a father&rsquo;s group--and after the big blizzard in  2010, the fathers got together and shoveled a mile of sidewalk so that their  children could walk to school.</p>

<p>One  father had not seen his son since the day he was born. But when his son sent  him a flyer to attend a father&rsquo;s day gathering at the school, the father came  and started visiting with his son every week. Today, his son is on the honor  roll.</p>

<p>And  finally, ask Andre Evans. Like Michael Powell, he didn&rsquo;t start out as a  teacher. Andrew was a district sales manager.</p>

<p>Then,  he heard about Howard&rsquo;s Ready to Teach program, which prepares African-American  men to become teachers in five urban school districts. With less than two  percent of our nation&rsquo;s teachers being black males, we need to support and  expand programs like Ready to Teach.</p>

<p>Andre&rsquo;s  school in Houston didn&rsquo;t have a library. So, every week Andre went to the  public library, carefully chose books for his second graders, and carted them  back to his classroom. He knew that you are not truly free if you cannot read.</p>

<p>Since  2007, Howard&rsquo;s Ready to Teach program has received 780 applicants for 80 slots.  Already, it has produced four teachers-of-the-year—and one of them is Andre  Evans. How many of you want to follow in his footsteps?</p>

<p>Four  years ago, when you arrived at Howard, Barack Obama was running for president. </p>

<p>Today,  he knows that our work is not done. He knows the future holds big challenges  and will require difficult choices and sacrifice.</p>

<p>But  he also knows that our future is bright because of young people like you—with  the skills, the creativity, the tenacity, and the passion to bring about real  and enduring change. </p>

<p>I  will never forget that November night four years ago—and I know you won&rsquo;t  either.</p>

<p>When  the election was called, students in the Blackburn Center jumped with joy. They  hugged one another--and wept. </p>

<p>The  President&rsquo;s election shattered barriers few dreamed would be broken in our  lifetimes.</p>

<p>But  there are still barriers ahead—and I have every faith that your generation will  break them. As the President said when he spoke at Howard&rsquo;s convocation in  2007, one man does not make a movement. Only you—together--can do that.</p>

<p>So,  as you leave here today, savor the moment. Cherish the celebration, your  family, and friends. But please, always remember you stand on the shoulders of  giants.</p>

<p>Today,  you graduate from Howard. Tomorrow, you face new opportunities and challenges.</p>

<p>And  when barriers rise up to meet you, when you start to question and doubt if you  have what it takes to succeed, remember that you are the proud, prepared  graduates of Howard University.</p>

<p>No  matter how high you climb, no matter how high you reach, you will always,  always feel the ladder beneath your feet.</p>

<p>I  could not be more proud of each and every one of you. Congratulations—and good  luck!</p></div></div></div>  </div>
