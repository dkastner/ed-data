<p>Today,  we're wrapping up a five-day bus tour of the Southwest and West. I want to tell  you about what I saw‚Äîand how the transformation of Castle Park Middle School is  a beautiful example of what I learned.</p>
<p>In  the five days we've been on the bus‚Äîand I have say, it's a pretty cool bus--we've  traveled over 1,100 miles across four states, from New Mexico to Texas, to  Arizona, and now here, to California. </p>
<p>We  have seen firsthand how courageous educators, committed parents, and caring  communities are pulling together to tackle tough educational challenges. They  are showing what it means to provide all children with a strong start and  bright future.</p>
<p>In  today's knowledge-based, globally competitive economy, a world-class education must  start with expanding access to high-quality early learning opportunities.</p>
<p>It  continues with holding ourselves to higher standards and expectations from elementary  school through high school.</p>
<p>And  it leads to preparing students both for a college education they can afford,  and a career of which they can be proud. </p>
<p>The  challenges to providing a world-class education today are very real. And they  are very urgent. Yet for every challenge that we saw, we also saw a community,  a school, and visionary leaders pulling together to meet that challenge. </p>
<p>Let  me tell you first about some of the challenges. At the Columbus Elementary  School, a border school in Columbus, New Mexico, 98 percent of the students  speak only Spanish. </p>
<p>Seventy-five  percent of the students‚Äîmore than 400 students-- live in Mexico. They were all  born in the U.S. and are U.S. citizens. And they walk across the border every day  and then take the bus to school.</p>
<p>Many  students bring with them a host of challenges. Some come from families where  electricity and indoor plumbing are luxuries. Some students had never held a  pencil or book when they arrived at school. </p>
<p>Tragically,  too many of our children are not getting a strong start in life. In New Mexico,  more than 60 percent of four-year olds‚Äîabout 17,000 children--are not served in  Head Start or the state's preschool program. About 90,000 of Arizona's 110,000  four-year olds are not enrolled in any publicly supported program. </p>
<p>That's  no way to provide equal opportunity and level the playing field for low-income  students. </p>
<p>States,  the federal government, and local communities must all invest in education. We  can't treat education as just another item on a budget line that can be arbitrarily  slashed during a budget crunch. Budgets aren't just numbers on a page‚Äîthey  reflect our collective values.</p>
<p>In  Arizona, I visited with tribal leaders who told me of the devastating impact  sequestration was having on Indian education. Sequestration represents the  worst of Washington and its political dysfunction. It hurts the very children  who most need educational opportunity.</p>
<p>In  Tempe, at Arizona State University, I talked to middle-class families and  students who were struggling to pay for college. </p>
<p>I  spoke to Hispanic parents and children who had done everything right--and were  desperate for comprehensive, common-sense immigration reform, so they could  make the dream of going to college a reality.</p>
<p>Yet  for all of these challenges, I saw great teachers, committed parents, and community  leaders solving tough problems.</p>
<p>At  Columbus Elementary in New Mexico, teachers used Skype to communicate with  parents on the other side of the border in Mexico. The principal, Armando  Chavez, had worked at Columbus for 13 years. The pre-K teacher, Charles  Scanlon, rose at dawn to meet his students at the border. That kind of  commitment was not in their job description‚Äîthey do it because they care so  much about the future of children.</p>
<p>In  New Mexico, the Republican governor, Susana Martinez, is making preschool a  reality for many more families. She has doubled the amount of funding for the  state's pre-K program in the last two years--and added nearly $5 million to  this year's budget to serve an additional 1,400 children.</p>
<p>At  TransMountain T-Stem Early College High School in El Paso, educators are making  learning relevant and rigorous for their students in the STEM disciplines‚Äî80  percent of whom are Hispanic and 60 percent of whom are poor. I walked into a  class of 9th graders‚Äî14-year olds‚Äîwho were taking a college biology  class, for college credit.</p>
<p>In  fact, all students at TransMountain can complete an associate's degree by the  end of their junior year and have the opportunity to attend the University of  Texas at El Paso during their senior year. And students can engage in robotics  and rocketry through a partnership with NASA. Students at TransMountain do not say  &quot;if I go to college&quot; but &quot;where am I going to college&quot;?</p>
<p>In  Yuma, the entire community embraces military families and their children--and  does everything it can to support children whose parents are deployed in Iraq  and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And  finally, at Arizona State University, the university has taken a series of innovative  steps to ensure that ASU remains affordable for middle-class students--from  first-generation college goers to low-income Hispanic students.</p>
<p>Under  President Crow's visionary leadership, ASU has increased access, strengthened  quality, and improved graduation rates‚Äîall while keeping costs low. That is a  model of effectiveness which colleges across the nation can follow.</p>
<p>So,  as we travelled the Southwest, we saw the same pattern repeated.</p>
<p>Successful  solutions and effective innovation inevitably originated at the local level,  not in Washington. They all entailed setting high standards and expectations  for students, coupled with real support. You won't hear Principal Bleisch tell  eighth graders that they somehow don't need to take Algebra II because they were  not born into affluent families.</p>
<p>And  while successful innovations originate at the local level, they flourish in  partnerships with nonprofits, community and faith-based organizations, and the  state and federal government. This is a shared responsibility‚Äîno one gets a  pass.</p>
<p>Tough  problems, like turning around persistently low-performing schools, require  collaborative, comprehensive solutions that challenge the status quo head on.  There is nothing simple about this work. Tough challenges force people out of  their traditional silos and push them beyond their comfort zones. That takes  courage‚Äîand a commitment to doing what is right, not what is easy.</p>
<p>In  the end, it takes a community to provide a well-rounded, world-class education.  It takes outstanding principals, great teachers, high-quality preschool,  after-school tutoring, arts, and sports programs, affordable health care  providers, and accessible community recreation centers. It takes committed  parents, business, non-profit, and faith-based leaders all working together on  behalf of children.</p>
<p>And  by the same token, it is also true that no community can ultimately succeed  without a great school at its center. Schools should be at the heart of  community life. The single surest path out of poverty today is still a high-quality  education. </p>
<p>Now,  all of these ingredients of success are easy to spot in the transformation of  Castle Park Middle School and the Chula Vista Promise Neighborhood zone.</p>
<p>The  Promise Neighborhood program is a homegrown initiative that extends the  decades-long work of South Bay Communities Services in Chula Vista. </p>
<p>Castle  Park's turnaround has been driven by an insistence on setting high expectations  for students--and a refusal to make excuses for students missing school or  failing to do homework, despite the real challenges students face in their  daily lives. </p>
<p>You  have implemented a series of locally-inspired solutions, including the Granger  Turnaround Model at Castle Park. And you have provided comprehensive wraparound  support services for students in the Chula Vista Promise Neighborhood, from  cradle to career.</p>
<p>You  have encouraged sustained and meaningful family engagement. You provided more  than 100 hours of training to parents and neighborhood residents to support  their children's learning through your model Promotoras program. You understand  the power of intergenerational education.</p>
<p>And  you did this all through a powerful partnership. South Bay Community Services  gathered 28 partners to form the Chula Vista Promise Neighborhood.</p>
<p>Local  agencies, nonprofits, and business all stepped up. And we were proud to support  and accelerate your work with a five-year, $28 million Promise Neighborhood  grant. While we hope our resources have been helpful, it is your hard work and  commitment‚Äîand not our money‚Äîthat is transforming children's life chances.</p>
<p>We  all know that turning around a school and revitalizing the community is some of  the toughest, most frustrating work in education. But it also some of the most  important and rewarding work you will ever have the privilege to undertake.</p>
<p>It  might be easy to forget now, but just three years ago, Castle Park Middle  School was an educational mess.</p>
<p>It  had the worst attendance record in the district. On some days, 75 kids would  miss school. More than half the students had no plans to go to college. Test  scores were abysmal.</p>
<p>But  leaders at Castle Park, at other schools in the district, and in the community  decided the status quo was unacceptable.</p>
<p>The  school implemented mandatory attendance, mandatory behavior, and mandatory  academic support systems.</p>
<p>All  students had to complete all missing homework assignments before they could go  home.</p>
<p>The  Promotoras program helped parents become more engaged and invested in their  children's academic success.</p>
<p>And  teachers found a new sense of collaboration and community respect, as they  helped to build a college-going culture at Castle Park for the first time.</p>
<p>All  of that hard work is creating a new world of opportunity for your students.  Castle Park now has the best attendance record in the district, with almost 100  percent of kids in class every day.</p>
<p>Test  scores have risen by nearly double-digits in almost every subject--and students  are taking more rigorous courses, like Algebra II in eighth grade.</p>
<p>And  all of Castle Park's students are being prepared to keep their eye on the ultimate  prize--a college education and career.</p>
<p>Castle  Park's turnaround is another profound example that when adults raise  expectations, children will rise to meet them. The whole country can learn from  what you've done here.</p>
<p>Now,  as much as we might like to, the federal government can't fund Promise  Neighborhoods everywhere. But the core ingredients of Promise  Neighborhoods‚Äîevidence-based; place-based; and covering cradle-to-career‚Äîthat holistic  approach can be adopted everywhere.</p>
<p>I  am pleased that there are many great examples of that comprehensive,  community-based approach in nearby San Diego‚Äîand across the nation. In San  Diego, the United Way and Strive's Cradle-to- Career network are working with  over 100 partners in the City Heights Partnership for Children. And Strive's  Cradle to Career network is now operating in more than 95 communities  nationwide.</p>
<p>The  President and I believe in place-based, neighborhood solutions. We both got our  start working in the community--and we know that is where real power is.</p>
<p>That's  why I've brought with me today the leaders of our White House Initiatives on  Educational Excellence for Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans and  Pacific Islanders, and American Indian and Alaska natives. The outstanding  leaders of our White House Center for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships  are here today, too--basically, our whole brain trust is honored to be with all  of you today.</p>
<p>Leaders  of each of the White House Initiatives will host break-out sessions after our  Town Hall concludes today. We want your innovative ideas, we want your input.</p>
<p>So,  as our nation's children head back to school, I am optimistic about our  capacity to elevate and strengthen education in America--despite the serious  challenges we face on a daily basis, the challenge of inadequate funding,  poverty, and family breakdown.</p>
<p>I  am optimistic because for four-and-a-half years and throughout this bus tour, I  have seen great school leaders and teachers, I have seen engaged parents and  committed communities pulling together to solve problems and provide all  students with a world-class education.</p>
<p>I  am optimistic because I have seen students with incredible grit and passion for  education who simply will not be denied‚Äîwhether they are a four-year old who  walks across the border every day, or 17-year-old Abagail Smith, who, as a  child of military parents, went to 10 different schools, as her family moved to  serve the nation. Abagail is planning on becoming a Special Ed teacher.</p>
<p>And  I am optimistic because I see encouraging signs of progress nationwide.</p>
<p>During  the Obama's administration first term, the high school graduation rate rose to  its highest level in three decades. And the news is especially promising for  Hispanics. Across America, college enrollment is rising more rapidly for  Hispanics than among any other group.</p>
<p>Just  last week, the Census Bureau reported that it estimates the number of Hispanic  students enrolled in college grew by more than 1.1 million from 2008 to 2012.</p>
<p>That  is 1.1 million more young people with a better chance of getting a good job,  owning their own homes, and supporting a family. They are living the American  Dream.</p>
<p>All  of this progress is happening even as states <em>raise</em> standards and expectations for children.<br />
  Forty-six  states, plus the District of Columbia, have now voluntarily adopted the  rigorous, state-crafted Common Core standards in English and mathematics.  California is helping to lead this effort--and Governor Brown has been a  champion here.</p>
<p>Higher  standards are a welcome sea-change in education. For too long, too many states  dummied down expectations for our students to make politicians look good. As a  nation, we are finally gaining the courage to stop lying to children and  families, and tell them the truth about their academic achievement.</p>
<p>To  our students here: you must work hard. I believe it is your job to get a good  education‚Äîno one can hand it to you.</p>
<p>To  parents, I would say, we will always be our children's first and most important  teachers. It is up to you to get to know your kids' teachers‚Äîand find out the  best ways to stay informed about their progress.</p>
<p>Learn  about the new, higher standards that are taking effect in so many states. And  help build meaningful partnerships between families and teachers, so teachers,  parents, and community partners collaborate to improve student engagement and  learning.</p>
<p>Educators  today are facing what may be some of the biggest changes in American education  in decades. The transition to higher standards is hard. Yet it is chock-full  with incredible opportunities.</p>
<p>Teachers  across the country know this is the right thing for their children, and for the  country. I would urge teachers and school leaders to step in and  participate--be a leader in this transition. </p>
<p>To  college presidents and administrators, I hope you will take seriously the  challenge to step out of the pack with innovations that both make college more affordable  and increase quality.  More of the same  won't solve the problem--or meet the needs of the middle-class.</p>
<p>And  finally, to Congress, I would say that by listening to local educators on this  tour, by getting out of Washington, I've learned more about what the  reauthorization of No Child Left Behind should include if we are going to  provide a world-class education to every child.</p>
<p>At  the schools I visited, the students are saying yes to art, yes to music, yes to  debate, yes to academic decathlon, yes to robotics. Students, parents, and  educators want a rich, well-rounded curriculum to be the norm, not the  exception. And we cannot provide a world-class education without funding it. </p>
<p>So,  to lawmakers, as you go back and visit schools in your district, sit in the  classrooms.</p>
<p>Don't  talk at teachers and parents. Listen to them. Get a first-hand sense of what is  really going on in our schools.</p>
<p>I  encourage you to use that experience to inform your thinking on what a strong,  reauthorized law should look like. We must fix the broken No Child Left Behind  law.</p>
<p>Ask  parents and educators, if they think education is an investment--or just another  expense on a budget line.</p>
<p>As  great an honor as it has been for me to serve President Obama, the biggest  thrill of my job is getting out of DC and into our schools to talk with  students, teachers, parents, and college leaders.</p>
<p>This  is my fourth back-to-school bus tour. I learn something new every time.</p>
<p>Yet  I never finish a bus tour without being reminded of the ingenuity and  commitment and passion of our teachers and students for an education.</p>
<p>W.E.B.  DuBois said that &quot;of all the civil rights for which the world has struggled and  fought for 5,000 years, the right to learn is undoubtedly the most  fundamental.&quot;</p>
<p>I  absolutely agree‚Äîand my fervent wish for every student is that they embrace and  enjoy the right to learn this school year.</p></div></div></div>  </div>
