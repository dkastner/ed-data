<p>Thank  you.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m  so honored to be back with all of you—this remarkable group of mothers, fathers  and educators, who, together, make up the oldest and largest child advocacy  organization in America.  Just to be  clear, none of you are old—it&rsquo;s the organization that&rsquo;s old!</p>

<p>Today,  the PTA is stronger than ever, and, for that, I want to publicly thank your  outgoing president, Otha Thornton, for his hard work, leadership, and committed  service.</p>

<p>I  also want to congratulate your new Executive Director, Nathan Monell and your incoming  President Laura Bay. You&rsquo;re in great hands with their leadership, and I want to  do everything I can to be a good partner to them.</p>

<p>And  lastly, I want to thank all of you. </p>

<p>As  parents, we know that nothing in our lives matters more than the wellbeing of our  children. </p>

<p>And  as educators, we understand that our life&rsquo;s work is to secure a better future for  our nation&rsquo;s students.</p>

<p>And  by joining the PTA, you&rsquo;re saying that it&rsquo;s not just about the kids you see  each day, but about all children in this country.  </p>

<p>In  taking that step, your actions make a profound statement. We need more adults  to care about, and invest in—every child.   As a nation, we cannot afford to lose any! </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s  why I was so encouraged to hear of yesterday&rsquo;s commitment by the PTA, to engage  more Hispanic parents in local change efforts. </p>

<p>This  school year, our public schools are estimated to be majority-minority for the first  time, and I appreciate the PTA&rsquo;s efforts to reflect our nation&rsquo;s diversity, including  those who have been historically marginalized.</p>


<h3>II. School Change is Hard  – And It&rsquo;s Impossible Without Parents</h3>

<p>If  ever there was a time when American public education needed the wisdom and  advocacy of the PTA, it&rsquo;s now.</p>

<p>The  world is in the midst of a massive shift—from the predictability of the Industrial  Age to the uncertainty of the Networked Age. And public schools—as always—are at  the center of that change.</p>

<p>  Yet,  whatever the innovation may be, the fact is that large-scale change is hard—and  it&rsquo;s impossible without parent involvement.</p>

<p>Otha  Thornton has noted that more than 40 years of&nbsp;research&nbsp;shows that &ldquo;no  matter a family's income or socioeconomic background, family engagement in  education is essential for student success.&rdquo; </p>

<p>My  friend, Dr. Tony Bryk came to a similar conclusion. Beginning in 1990, Tony and  his team conducted a 15-year study across hundreds of elementary schools in my  home of Chicago, to try and distinguish why some were able to improve and  others were not. </p>

<p>What  he found was that five organizational features of a school, regardless of where  it is or what type of children it serves, will determine whether or not  learning can thrive: </p>

<ol>
  <li>A  clear vision for instruction; </li>
  <li>A  staff with the capacity to see that vision through; </li>
  <li>A  student-centered learning environment; </li>
  <li>Skilled  leadership; and </li>
  <li><em>Active and engaged  parents</em>.</li>
</ol>


<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t about  doing one or two of these things in isolation. It was about doing them all in  tandem.  We know that is not easy, but we  also know that is reality—the work is always hard, and multiple factors always  contribute to success that is real and lasting.</p>

 <p> In  fact, schools that did all five well were <em>10  times</em> more likely to improve than schools that didn&rsquo;t. Tony put it this  way: &ldquo;School development is much like baking a cake.&rdquo; </p>

<p>You  need every ingredient. </p>

<p>Dr.  Bryk also identified a &ldquo;special sauce&rdquo; that emerged whenever you mixed all five  together—a deep wellspring of trust between parents and educators. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s  hard to define, but it&rsquo;s critical to get right. Because the road to better  relationships—and deep trust—between parents and schools cannot be paved merely  by good intentions or &ldquo;random acts of engagement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In  too many schools, the basic components of parent engagement are missing. And  it&rsquo;s a two-way street: lots of parents feel either unwelcome or unable to  contribute meaningfully to the life of the school. </p>

<p>And,  lots of educators do not see a clear path to integrating parents and families more  fully into the learning process, and struggle to find parents to engage in the  life of the school.</p>

<p>You  are helping to change those dynamics, along with organizations like UNCF, the  National Council of La Raza, America Achieves, and many others by giving  parents tools and ensuring they know how to ask the right questions to demand  the best outcomes for all children. </p>

<p>But,  we all have so much more work to do, together, to ensure that every child has  the education that is her civil right.  </p>

<p>Giving  every child an equal opportunity to learn is the central challenge of our era,  and will determine whether our nation grows stronger or struggles in years  ahead.  </p>

<p>Like  every other civil right, this one has not been freely given to everyone. It&rsquo;s  taken a fight—and it will continue to. </p>

<p>I  want to describe a set of educational rights that I firmly believe must belong  to every family in America—and I hope you&rsquo;ll demand that your leaders in elected  and appointed offices deliver on them. They come together as a set of rights that  students must have at three pivotal stages of their life, to prepare them for success  in college and careers and as engaged, productive citizens.</p>

<h3>III. Three Rights (&amp; Responsibilities) That Can Unite Us</h3>

<p>First,  every child should have the right to attend a free, high-quality preschool.</p>

<p>Research  confirms what every parent knows: that the first five years of a child&rsquo;s life  matter greatly in determining what sort of adult he is likely to become. </p>

<p>So  if we are serious about providing all our children with good choices in life,  if we are serious about our nation&rsquo;s economic strength, it&rsquo;s this simple: We  must get rid of the obsolete belief that a quality education begins at age five  and ends at age eighteen. </p>

<p>That  isn&rsquo;t enough to equip our kids for success today.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s  why President Obama and I believe we must expand access to high-quality early  childhood education. And we&rsquo;re seeing a totally different conversation in this  country than we were even a few years ago. In more conservative states like  Texas and Alabama, and liberal states like Minnesota, Governors are providing  real leadership on this.  </p>

<p>But  there are still too many people in positions of influence who say we can&rsquo;t  afford this sort of expense. </p>

<p>To  which I say, &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To  quote Derek Bok: &ldquo;If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.&rdquo; </p>

<p>But  it&rsquo;s not just smart policy—high-quality preschool is the <em>right thing to do </em>to make sure every child is set up for success in  school. </p>

<p>We  must come together as a nation—to do the right thing for our youngest children.  And we must hold our elected officials accountable.</p>
<p>Second,  I believe all children have the right to high, challenging standards and  engaging teaching and leadership in a safe, supportive, well-resourced school. </p>

<p>The  demands of the real world have changed.   It&rsquo;s no longer just about what you know—it&rsquo;s about what you can do with  your knowledge. It&rsquo;s about problem-solving and creativity and working together  with others to forge new solutions to complex problems. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s  about schools that ask themselves whether they&rsquo;ve truly engaged students and  equipped them with the wide range of skills—intellectual, and socio-emotional  that will translate into success in life.   That&rsquo;s what I see great teachers doing as I visit classrooms across the  country.</p>

<p>The  great news is that, in so many places, educators have put into place many of  the building blocks for these changes. </p>

<p>And,  amid these huge changes, students are making vital progress, thanks to the hard  work of those educators, families, communities, and our students themselves.</p>

<p>Our  high school graduation rate has never  been higher, and the dropout rate has never been lower, with especially  strong progress for students of color. And college enrollment by black and Latino  students is up by more than a million since 2008. </p>

<p>But  it&rsquo;s not just about more kids graduating. It&rsquo;s about more kids graduating ready  for their future. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s  why, when I think about the ideal classroom, I think about teachers who  recognize that learning occurs when kids see their classes less as isolated  subjects and more as opportunities for exploration, discovery, and mastery.</p>

<p>That  can only happen with resources and support—and unfortunately, that&rsquo;s going to  take a fight.</p>

<p>On  Capitol Hill, just in the past week, in both the House and Senate, Republicans  are proposing to cut billions from the education budget, and to end some of the  efforts that are having greatest impact. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s  exactly the wrong choice for our children and for our country. We need to fight  for the resources needed to do the most important job in America.  Education should never be about politics. We  should all want the best for our kids. </p>

<p>We  also need to fight for high expectations for all our students, so students—no  matter where they live—know that if they work hard and get good grades in high  school, they&rsquo;ll be ready for the challenges of college and careers. </p>

<p>We  can&rsquo;t go back to a time when we gave students with disabilities or low-income  students far easier tests to hide achievement gaps. We need to fight for  better, fewer statewide assessments that measure students&rsquo; progress every year. </p>

<p>That  helps educators and school systems improve instruction for kids, but it only  works well if everyone participates. I know that there are parents who have real  concerns about testing, but I urge them to participate and continue to use  their voices to improve how assessment works for children, parents, and  educators. </p>

<p>Last  year, I told this group that I share the concern of many parents that standardized  testing has come to have an outsized footprint in the lives of many schools and  educators. One part of the solution is simply to reduce the duplicative and  unnecessary assessments some states and districts have layered on over the  years, which is why I&rsquo;ve proposed capping—limiting—the total amount of  instructional time that can be spent on preparing for and taking tests.  </p>

<p>Yet  in all of this, we must not lose sight of the larger goal: to create and  develop schools that help young people fall in love with learning and discover  their unique skills, talents, and passion. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s  why I believe we must continue to advocate for making learning more  personalized, customized, and relevant for each individual child—and for  ensuring that our teacher preparation and licensure programs are giving our  teachers what they need to be successful in today&rsquo;s classrooms.</p>

<p>To  do that, we must stop tolerating our own stubborn insistence that schools today  somehow continue to closely resemble the schools of our youth.</p>

<p>We  have the right to expect something more transformative for our children going  forward. But we also have the responsibility to give educators better support  than they have had in a time of great change. </p>

<p>The  education our kids need can&rsquo;t start in kindergarten and can&rsquo;t stop at high  school. The world has changed—there aren&rsquo;t great paths out there for kids with just  a high school diploma and nothing else. And there&rsquo;s nothing that matters more  to us than our kids having a secure, stable future.  All parents want their child to have a better  life, and more opportunity, than they had.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s  why I believe we must see an affordable, high-quality college degree as every  child&rsquo;s right.</p>

<p>Our  collective goal must be for every student to graduate from high school and  obtain some form of postsecondary training or degree. </p>
<p>To  try to help us get there, our administration has produced the largest  investment in student aid for college since the G.I. Bill.</p>

<p>The  number of Pell Grant recipients has increased by 50 percent since 2008.</p>

<p>And  we have eased burdens on students by capping repayment of loans for all  eligible students at 10 percent&nbsp;of their monthly income.</p>

<p>We  cannot rest until every student in this country has a path toward a high-quality  degree they can afford and, frankly, we are not close yet. </p>

<p>We  must also ensure that our K-12 system is actually preparing young people for  the academic rigor of college. Today, college remediation rates are staggering,  costing students time, and parents and taxpayers money.  It is not fair to anyone. </p>

<p>Just  as Tony Bryk&rsquo;s research made clear, these seemingly separate stages of the  educational journey are actually deeply interdependent.  Access to early childhood, academic rigor in  K-12, and affordable higher ed—each opportunity builds on the one before  it.  
</p>

<h3> IV. Conclusion</h3>

<p>When  it comes to actually making those things happen, few voices are as powerful as  yours.  Politicians—way too often—get  away with calling themselves &ldquo;the education candidate,&rdquo; without having to put  action behind those words. No politician runs as an &ldquo;anti-education candidate,&rdquo;  but do many actually create better opportunities for our children?  Far too many do not.  You must change that.</p>

<p>Ask  every politician—across the political spectrum—at the local, state, and  national levels, what&rsquo;s your plan to improve outcomes for kids? What&rsquo;s your  plan to ensure that students not only go to college in increasing numbers, but also  graduate—and do so without a burden of debt that will hinder their life  choices?  What is their concrete goal for  high school graduation rates, and how will they accomplish it?  Will they fund high-quality early childhood  ed or won&rsquo;t they?</p>

<p>Challenge  the people who need your vote. Ask them to earn your vote by doing right by  your children, and by every child in this country. Demand that they deliver on  the rights of your family and every family. </p>

<p>Finally,  as one of the people who tries every day to earn and maintain your trust, let  me simply say: thank you. Thank you for serving as essential partners with your children&rsquo;s teachers. </p>

<p>Thank  you for working to ensure that students and parents feel connected—and teachers  feel supported.  Thank you for building  the trust that needs to live in every school.</p>

<p>And  thank you for having me!  Let&rsquo;s continue  this discussion after today. Please join me on July 1st at 1:30 PM, for a  follow-up conversation about the importance of parent engagement on Twitter.</p>
<p>You  can join in using the hashtag &ldquo;PTChat.&rdquo;  I  know we have time for just a few questions so let&rsquo;s jump into today&rsquo;s conversation.</p>

<p>  Thank you!</p></div></div></div>  </div>
