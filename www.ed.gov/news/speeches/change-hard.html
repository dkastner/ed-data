<p>I  can stand up here and sell you on the importance of reform.  I can get hyped up about how we&rsquo;re falling  behind other countries. I&rsquo;ve said those  things a thousand times.  And I believe  in them.  Reform is vital--and in several  key areas, America is slipping.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s  why President Obama spent $60 billion to keep teachers in the classroom.  That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s calling for another $25  billion right now to protect teaching jobs.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s  why – year after year – he has protected education from budget cuts – and  that&rsquo;s why he has pushed a bold agenda for change.</p>

<p>He fundamentally believes in education as the pathway out of poverty and the  pathway to a strong, secure future.</p>

<p>And we both believe that teachers are the heart and soul of our education system-- and  that our success as a country is entirely dependent on your success as a  teacher.</p>

<p>You  are doing the hard, critically important work every day. And no matter what happens at the federal, state,  or district level – it only matters if it works in your classrooms.</p>

<p>So  first of all – I want to say thank you. Thank you for doing this work. Thank you for taking on the immense responsibility  of educating our children.  Nothing is  more important to our future – to our economic security –even our national  security.</p>

<p>Second,  I want to share the truth as I see it. I  won&rsquo;t sugarcoat facts or paint a fantasy where every child&rsquo;s social and  emotional needs are always met in their home, and where the learning  environment in every school is perfectly suited to support your work each day. That&rsquo;s not our children&rsquo;s reality. And I know that is not your reality.</p>

<p>We  live in an imperfect world. Some children  are challenged by poverty, neighborhood, or family issues that are almost  unimaginable.  Some schools are  underfunded. Some principals are  overwhelmed. And some teachers feel  unsupported.  They&rsquo;re tired of feeling attacked.</p>

<p>And  yet, even in those difficult circumstances, you are helping kids learn in  remarkable ways.  Every day, in  classrooms all across America, students are overcoming huge barriers and succeeding because of caring, devoted teachers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve  been to 47 states in the last three years – inner-cities, small towns, native-American  reservations – remote communities in places like Alaska. We flew there in a small plane with duct tape on the wings. You can&rsquo;t make this stuff up.</p>

<p>I remind you that my sport is basketball – not skydiving. I don&rsquo;t even like jumping very high.  I might be the only six-foot-four inch tall basketball  player in the world who can&rsquo;t dunk.</p>

<p>But I went to these states and saw people doing incredible things – and it always both  gives me hope and affirms for me the generous and giving nature of people who  choose to go into education.</p>

<p>Teachers  want to make a difference in the lives of others.  They get their greatest reward by helping their  students discover themselves, find their voice, and develop into self-confident  and well-directed people.</p>

<p>You  simply can&rsquo;t say that about every profession.   Some people are motivated by money or power or ego or a large corner  office. But teachers are uniquely driven  by the desire to help others succeed.</p>

<p>Teaching  is really hard work. It requires creativity, knowledge, skills, and empathy –  the kind of emotional intelligence that can&rsquo;t be readily acquired.  It&rsquo;s in your heart.</p>

<p>And  that&rsquo;s your strength – but it also makes you vulnerable when educational decisions beyond your control feel wrong. You give your life to this work, and you don&rsquo;t want to see it go off-track. This is your craft. You know what is needed.</p>

<p>So today I want to have an open, honest conversation. I&rsquo;ll share a few thoughts  and then hear from you and take some questions. I hope that we can improve our common  understanding of what we can all do, together, to get better and give all our  children a chance to be successful.</p>

<p>In  the last three years, there have been three really significant developments in K-12  education. The first is that all but a  handful of states have raised academic standards, in an effort to prepare  children for college and careers.</p>

<p>The  internationally-benchmarked Common Core standards were developed by educators  on behalf of the states. They have been reviewed extensively and they get generally strong marks – higher than most  standards – and comparable to some of the best.</p>

<p>Now  they&rsquo;re going into the field – which means that teachers, principals, and administrators will have to figure out what this means in the classroom.</p>

<p>How  will this affect curriculum?  How will it  change your daily lesson plans? Will you have more autonomy or less? And how can you best learn from, and share with,  your colleagues across the country?</p>

<p>When children are assessed against new, higher standards, how will parents, teachers  and schools react?  If scores drop, will everyone  feel deflated and beaten down?  Or will we  all be inspired to work harder?</p>

<p>And when the shelf life of so many education reforms is brief, how do we know that  high standards that truly prepare young people for college and careers will take root and become the norm—not just for the privileged, but for all?</p>

<p>One never knows what the future holds, but this country is now committed to high standards. It&rsquo;s one issue on which  Democrats and Republicans, parents and teachers, and employers and higher education  leaders can all agree.  </p>

<p>The  fact is that today 25 percent of our kids don&rsquo;t even graduate from high school.  About half of all students who go to  community college need remedial education. And over 90 million adults in  America have limited literacy skills.</p>

<p>Our families, our communities, and our country deserves better. And we won&rsquo;t change  those numbers without high standards and high expectations.</p>

<p>One of the many negative side effects of No Child Left Behind is that too many states lowered standards in order to meet the goal of getting every single  child to proficiency by 2014.</p>

<p>It  is a noble goal. And the fact that we are falling short of it does not mean the  goal is wrong, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean we have failed. It just means we have more work to do because  we&rsquo;re committed to all children--regardless of their talents, background, and  challenges.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the 2014 goal – along with the mandates and punitive sanctions in NCLB – put a  lot of pressure on schools and teachers. In some cases we saw more focus on test prep and a narrowing of the  curriculum. </p>

<p>Those are not good outcomes for children – and it&rsquo;s not a good use of your time  either. You didn&rsquo;t go into education in  order to teach kids how to pass a bubble test.</p>

<p>And you don&rsquo;t want an accountability system that labels improving schools as failures or ignores the challenges children bring into the classroom. Teachers, principals—all of us, really--want  a system that is fair, honest, and realistic.</p>

<p>And this has led to the second really big thing that has happened on our watch –  which is NCLB waivers.  </p>

<p>We tried hard to get Congress to fix the broken NCLB law. We sought to make it  more fair and flexible, and better focused on the kids most at risk. But right  now Congress is pretty broken as well.</p>

<p>As  President Obama has said, repeatedly, &ldquo;We Can&rsquo;t Wait&rdquo; for Congress to act, so  we used our authority to offer flexibility to states willing to change.<br />
  <br />
  Basically,  we said to the states – raise standards, set performance targets that are  ambitious and achievable -- and design local interventions that focus closely on the neediest children.</p>

<p>In exchange for protecting children and setting a high bar, you get much more  flexibility with our funds and the chance to create your own state-designed  accountability system.</p>

<p>We  also asked states to come up with a better way to support teachers and principals.  Look at annual student growth and progress  rather than proficiency.And use other measures of effectiveness – like  classroom observation, peer review, and parent and student feedback.</p>

<p>We further encouraged states to develop new ways to support and evaluate teachers  in all subjects –the arts, foreign languages, science, history, and physical  education.</p>

<p>We  didn&rsquo;t eliminate testing because we believe it is important to measure  progress. We need to know who is ahead  and who is behind – who is succeeding and who needs more support.  In an ideal world, that data should also drive  instruction and meaningful professional development.</p>

<p>We  absolutely understand that standardized tests don&rsquo;t begin to capture all of the  subtle qualities of successful teaching. That&rsquo;s why we always call for multiple measures in evaluating teachers,  schools, districts, and states.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re  also hopeful that new assessments under development will better reflect the  impact of your work.  But they are still a few years away.</p>

<p>In the meantime, dozens of states have seized this opportunity for flexibility  with interventions and the chance to set new performance targets – including Maryland.   </p>

<p>A  few states are staying with current law – and that&rsquo;s their choice.  We&rsquo;re for flexibility as long as we have the goal  of giving every child a college and career-ready education.</p>

<p>Overall, however, more than 60 percent of schools in America have new accountability  systems in place that are both realistic and ambitious – and that capture more  kids at risk than NCLB ever did.  We  expect that number to go even higher.</p>

<p>Now, the third big thing to happen is that we are having a very robust national  conversation around teaching and school leadership. This is a very important conversation that&rsquo;s  long overdue.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s  not an easy conversation either. It requires principals and teachers to look hard at themselves and ask – what would  it take for us all to get better?</p>

<p>The  conversation started around teacher evaluation. But it has now expanded to  cover a full range of pressing issues, like teacher preparation, professional  development, career ladders, tenure, and compensation. Everyone is part of the conversation,  including unions, administrators, and school boards.  </p>

<p>At  a groundbreaking conference we hosted in Cincinnati in May, leaders from NEA,  the AFT, and the national associations representing school boards,  superintendents, chief state school officers, and large urban districts – all publicly signed a document spelling  out seven principles for reforming the teaching profession.</p>

<p>This  document is truly historic. Created with  a united front and a real sense of collaboration, it provides a strong  foundation for comprehensive reform. It promotes the importance of shared  responsibility and accountability, a healthy school culture, enhanced teacher  leadership, strong community engagement, multiple career pathways, and all of  the elements needed for success.</p>

<p>Most  important, teachers themselves are driving this national conversation.  With the help of our Teacher Ambassador  Fellows – these are fantastic, active classroom teachers working for a year  with us--we held over 200 roundtables last year with more than 3,500 teachers  across the country to shape a new vision for the teaching profession.</p>

<p>We  call it the RESPECT project and the results are on our website. It&rsquo;s closely aligned to the vision document signed  by all of us in Cincinnati – especially the focus on shared  responsibility.  </p>

<p>We  invite all of you to join the discussion.   In fact, our teaching fellows are here today, and they plan to stick  around, hold some roundtables, and talk with some of you about the RESPECT  project.</p>

<p>Please  tell us your vision for the profession and think through with us how we can get  there.</p>

<p>The  hard questions are so important: How do we change teacher prep programs to better  prepare all teachers for the classroom? </p>

<p>How do we change recruiting and mentoring and induction so new teachers feel  supported, instead of isolated and overwhelmed? How do we ensure our nation&rsquo;s  teachers reflect the great diversity of our nation&rsquo;s students?</p>

<p>And how do we build career pathways where great teachers can stay in the classroom and earn salaries that are competitive with other professions like medicine and  law?  </p>

<p>You  know what success looks like. You know  what it would take to transform the field. We are not looking for incremental  change here—this effort is much more ambitious than that.</p>

<p>And you definitely know what you want in your school and your classroom– whether it  is more time to plan and collaborate, more support from school leaders, or more  autonomy to structure class time in ways that best serve your students.</p>

<p>And,  as I&rsquo;ve said repeatedly, you also deserve much better pay—especially if it&rsquo;s  tied to effectiveness.  I know you didn&rsquo;t  go into education to get rich, but you shouldn&rsquo;t have to sign a vow of poverty  either. Teacher salaries should be on  par with other valued professions.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve  asked Congress for $5 billion to get the ball rolling and we&rsquo;re directing other  funding streams to support this work. But ultimately this will play out at the  state and local level, which funds the vast bulk of public education.</p>

<p>Your  voice in rebuilding and renewing your profession is so important--and the opportunity  has never been greater or more urgent. Almost half of our existing teachers are set to retire in the current decade. A million new people are coming into this  field.</p>

<p>Today,  however, half of those new teachers will leave the field within five  years. That is unacceptable. And many other  bright, young people don&rsquo;t even consider teaching – either because salaries are  too low, opportunities for advancement are limited, or working conditions are  too difficult.</p>

<p>As  a country, we&rsquo;re beginning to change those dynamics. And teachers are leading  the change –through their unions or with grassroots groups like Teach Plus and  Educators 4 Excellence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile,  everyone is working harder than ever before to figure out how to raise  standards.  Right here in Maryland, the  state held a conference last summer with 6,000 teachers to discuss  implementation of the Common Core.</p>

<p>Maryland  held regional meetings, and sponsored conferences to familiarize teachers with Common Core content. They developed and  posted online lessons.  </p>

<p>This fall, Maryland will field test teacher and principal evaluations based on multiple measures and fine-tune it before implementing.</p>

<p>To  shape this new system of evaluation, Maryland established an Educator Effectiveness Council with unions, teachers, superintendents, school board  members, and academics.</p>

<p>Under  its NCLB waiver, Maryland has set ambitious new goals to reduce achievement gaps by half within six years, asking districts to develop locally-designed plans  for improvement.</p>

<p>Now,  I&rsquo;m convinced that Maryland is poised to lead the country. But no one believes this  will be easy. There will absolutely be  stumbles and maybe a few wrong turns. The transition to higher standards will  be choppy for everyone, including teachers, administrators, parents, and  students.</p>

<p>But  we can&rsquo;t give up. We have to keep trying  – keep getting better – keep pushing ourselves and each other.  And when we encounter obstacles, we have to  go over them, around them, or through them.</p>

<p>Let  me tell you about Tennessee – which, like Maryland, was another Race to the Top  winner.</p>

<p>A year ago, the state put in place a new statewide evaluation system. There was a  lot of resistance.  But instead of digging in their heels or retreating, the Tennessee Department of Education did  the unthinkable for a government agency: They asked for feedback.</p>

<p>They met with 7,500 teachers around the state and surveyed 16,000 teachers and 1,000  administrators. They adapted and changed  the evaluation system based upon all that feedback, and the results are already  promising.</p>

<p>Meanwhile,  a wonderful music teacher in Memphis named Dru Davison was so frustrated by his  proposed evaluation that he also did the unthinkable. Working with his fellow arts educators, he  helped create a blind, peer-review evaluation system for assessing teacher practice in the arts.</p>

<p>It  proved so popular and effective that the entire district adopted it -- and now  the state itself is looking at doing the same.</p>

<p>This  is the kind of initiative we want to support all across the nation: teachers rebuilding  their own profession, holding themselves and each other accountable, and shaping  their future in the classroom.  And we  need to proceed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Your  fantastic new superintendent Dallas Dance talks about &ldquo;deliberate excellence.&rdquo;  He knows kids only have one chance at a  quality education.</p>

<p>Dr.  Martin Luther King often talked about &ldquo;the fierce urgency of now.&rdquo;  President Obama authorized waivers because we  can&rsquo;t wait for a divided Congress to act and fix a law that is so fundamentally  broken.</p>

<p>Every day matters.  Every day counts.  That&rsquo;s why, as a country, we&rsquo;re asking more  of ourselves, more of our principals and administrators, more of our students, more  of their parents, and more of you.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re  asking more from all of us because that is what it takes to get better. That is what it takes to fulfill the true promise  of public education. This is what  children desperately need.</p>

<p>Change  is always hard, and top-down accountability too often feels punitive.  At the end of the day, accountability comes  from within – from teachers holding themselves to high standards because they  take their profession seriously and want to see children succeed.</p>

<p>Let  me tell you about a couple of extraordinary teachers I met.</p>

<p>Jamie  Irish is a math teacher in New Orleans. He started teaching in the Bronx. But like many young teachers, he struggled  to reach his low-income students. He felt  overwhelmed. He switched to a private  school -- but then felt like he lost his purpose.</p>

<p>He  finally found it again in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. He chose to work with the kids that many  others had abandoned. He knew they were  way behind. But he challenged them to outperform the selective enrollment school  down the road.</p>

<p>He  calls his students the Orange Crush.  He wears  an orange jumpsuit to inspire them. Most  important, he&rsquo;s reaching those kids. Children  who no one believed in before are starting to believe in themselves.</p>

<p>His  students are the fastest-gaining kids in the system and he&rsquo;s been named teacher of the year in New Orleans.  He&rsquo;s been awarded the Fishman Prize for teaching by the New Teacher Project.</p>

<p>That prize is named for a current math teacher in D.C. named Shira Fishman.  She is a former engineer who felt unfulfilled  so she went into teaching nine years ago.</p>

<p>She has the highest ratings of any teacher in D.C. She&rsquo;s the teacher of the year and she&rsquo;s a Milken Award winner.  She&rsquo;s a mentor to younger teachers. And she coaches basketball.</p>

<p>She took a big pay cut to teach, and like some of you, she had to supplement her  income waiting tables.  How many doctors  or lawyers have to wait tables on the side?</p>

<p>She  acknowledges that teacher evaluation is stressful – but it&rsquo;s necessary. In her own words, she says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teachers  who are struggling need to be helped. The ones that are continuously ineffective need to find a different  career because it&rsquo;s not good for the kids. Those that are good need to be acknowledged and used by the school to help everyone get better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her  philosophy of teaching is equally clear. It&rsquo;s all about high expectations. She believes that if we keep raising the bar, our children will get over  it– but only if we help them overcome their fear of failure.</p>


<p>Here  in Baltimore County, and all across America, there are teachers like Shira  Fishman. They are giving everything they have to their children, and asking for  nothing in return, except for appreciation for their hard work and respect for their profession.</p>

<p>I  have one last teacher story from right here in Maryland that illustrates the  spirit, passion, and persistence of our classroom teachers.</p>

<p>Maddie  Hanington teaches English in Gaithersburg.  She was raised in the projects.  Her parents are immigrants from Puerto Rico and  she understands what it takes to help kids of color achieve.</p>

<p>She took a middle-school troublemaker on a path to failure and turned him into a  science fair winner. More often than  not, she dug into her own pocket for his lunch money.</p>

<p>Maddie is also a Milken Award winner.  Her  students are performing really well. She runs a book club for Latina girls –  and she&rsquo;s a mentor to her colleagues.  </p>

<p>She&rsquo;s  everything we could ever want in a teacher. And she&rsquo;s one of the three million  reasons why this administration has the deepest respect and appreciation for you and your work. We believe in you and  in the amazing power of education to transform lives.</p>

<p>We know the quality of a school system is only as good as the quality of its  teachers and leaders. And we consider it our solemn duty to support you and  honor your good work.</p>

<p>We also know that many of the changes underway are difficult and will take time. But  we all have to meet this challenge together because the children who will be in  front of you on Monday only get one chance at an education.</p>

<p>So as you begin the school year, please know that we are absolutely confident in  you and in your ability to give all of our children the one thing they need to  be successful in life: A world-class, well-rounded education.</p>

<p>Thank  you.</p></div></div></div>  </div>
