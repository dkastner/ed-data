<p>These partnerships will allow students&#151;particularly low-income students&#151;to access federal student aid for the first time to enroll in programs offered by non-traditional training providers, in partnership with colleges and universities, including coding bootcamps, online courses, and employer organizations. The goals of the experiment are to: (1) test new ways of allowing Americans from all backgrounds to access innovative learning and training opportunities that lead to good jobs, but that fall outside the current financial aid system; and (2) strengthen approaches for outcomes-based quality assurance processes that focus on student learning and other outcomes. The experiment aims to promote and measure college access, affordability, and student outcomes.</p>

<p>EQUIP falls under the Experimental Sites Initiatives, which test the effectiveness of statutory and regulatory flexibility for postsecondary institutions that disburse federal financial aid. Through the EQUIP program, the Department seeks to learn about these new models and their costs and educational and employment outcomes for students, as well as explore new methods to measure quality. Testing and learning from this program may help inform future policy reforms.</p>

<p>"I'm thrilled that students will soon have access to these innovative programs, developed in partnership with colleges and new providers, with the help of federal financial aid," said Under Secretary of Education Ted Mitchell. "As these innovative programs continue to develop, it will be increasingly important to understand what an outcomes-based quality assurance system looks like for such programs. I am encouraged to see that these colleges, providers, and quality assurance entities have stepped forward to provide models for doing so."</p>

<h3>Why we are launching EQUIP</h3>

<p>Over the next decade, the share of jobs requiring some level of higher education is expected to grow more rapidly than those that do not, with 11 of the 15 fastest-growing occupations requiring a postsecondary education. That is why the Obama Administration has worked to ensure that all students have access to a high-quality, affordable higher education. From the First in the World grants with which institutions of higher education designed and are testing innovative approaches to teaching and supporting students, to recent changes that will allow students to apply for federal aid earlier and more simply, the U.S. Department of Education has continuously worked to promote college access, affordability, and completion.</p>

<p>The expansion of higher education to more students means that students today are more likely to be older, living away from campus, and attending part-time while balancing work and school. To meet the needs of all students, our higher education system must continue to innovate and evolve.</p>

<p>There are many efforts across the higher education community to explore new ideas and affordable models for offering a quality education, such as short-term credential options, and online or blended skills training that is responsive to the need for accountable innovation. These programs can be accessible, affordable, and customized to the needs of a diverse student population.</p>

<p>For students seeking access to these new models of education, there are two key barriers to enrolling: lack of access to financial aid, and lack of information about the program's quality that can help students make a confident choice about whether to enroll. Because many of these new models fall outside of the traditional higher education system, students who wish to participate in them do not have access to federal financial aid. This experiment is designed to build on Administration efforts to increase access and strengthen transparency with tools like the College Scorecard, and to enable the Department to learn more about both issues in a new context.</p>

<h3>How the experiment will work</h3>

<p>EQUIP will provide federal financial aid to eligible students enrolled in the selected institutions' programs with non-traditional providers. Under the Higher Education Act, colleges and universities are barred from receiving federal student aid for programs in which at least half of the content and instruction is provided by an ineligible entity rather than the institution. As part of an experiment designed to explore the efficacy of the approach, EQUIP will enable students at the selected colleges and universities to receive federal financial aid for programs that exceed the 50 percent cap, thereby increasing access for students to new types of programs and allowing the Department to consider whether those programs resulted in positive student outcomes and how to track meaningful quality measures.</p>

<p>Each partnership between institutions and non-traditional providers will be reviewed and monitored by an independent, third-party quality assurance entity (QAE). QAEs will hold the non-traditional providers and postsecondary institutions accountable by assessing the student outcomes, including learning and employment and the management of the program. Additionally, the institution's accrediting agency must determine that this new program falls within the institution's accreditation.</p>

<h3>How the sites were selected</h3>

<p>Applications were evaluated on five criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong><em>Innovating to Improve Outcomes</em></strong>: The extent to which the proposed activities will produce innovative, high-quality programs likely to lead to positive student learning and employment outcomes;</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Equity and Access</em></strong>: The extent to which the programs will provide equitable access to high-quality postsecondary education programs, particularly for students from low-income backgrounds;</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Quality Assurance</em></strong>: The extent to which the proposed quality assurance processes have the potential to address key questions about how best to evaluate and ensure the quality of these programs and nontraditional providers;</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Affordability</em></strong>: The extent to which the programs are affordable;</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Student and Taxpayer Protections</em></strong>: Particularly for programs in which students will have access to federal student loans, the strength of proposed student and taxpayer protections.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Based on these criteria, a limited number of institutions were invited today to continue to <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/15/2015-26239/notice-inviting-postsecondary-educational-institutions-to-participate-in-experiments-under-the#p-119">Phase 3</a> of the selection process, in which the institutions will begin to set up their proposed programs and apply to the Department for final approval. These institutions, their non-traditional provider partners, and their quality assurance entities are listed below.</p>

<h3>Selected Sites</h3>

<p><strong>Institution: Colorado State University Global Campus (Greenwood Village, CO)<br>

The program will be continuously evaluated by two quality assurance entities: Entangled Solutions and Moody, Famiglietti &amp; Andronico, LLP (MFA). Entangled Solutions will have responsibility for setting and monitoring outcomes-based standards for the program including claims for learning, assessments, student work, placement rates, earnings growth, and student satisfaction, while MFA will provide independent auditing to verify the program's reported data, particularly for employment outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Institution: Wilmington University (New Castle, Delaware)<br>
Non-traditional provider: Zip Code Wilmington<br>
Quality assurance entity: HackerRank</strong></p>

<p>Wilmington will partner with Zip Code Wilmington, a nonprofit software development organization, to offer a 12-week boot camp program in Software Development that will provide students with skills to pursue an entry-level position using Java programming language. Zip Code Wilmington places graduates of the boot camp in either long-term apprenticeships or direct-hire employment, and plans to help find employment for its students with one of its many corporate partners. Wilmington and Zip Code Wilmington have engaged Hacker Rank to serve as the program's quality assurance entity assess student learning, track progress, benchmark performance, assess skills, and measure employment outcomes.</p></div></div></div>  </div>
