  &ldquo;The  number of children ages 5 to 17 in the U.S. who speak a language other than  English at home has more than doubled in the past three decades. These home  languages are an asset that should be valued, and research shows that  supporting bilingualism from early ages can have wide ranging benefits, from  cognitive and social advantages early in life, to long-term employment  opportunities and competitiveness in the workplace. This statement is part of  ED's ongoing commitment to ensure that dual  language learners, including immigrants and refugees,  have access to high quality supports, which is especially important as we  celebrate Immigrant Heritage Month.&rdquo;</p>
  
<p>Today the White House is announcing a new <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ecd/dual-language-learners">Federal  policy statement</a> from the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and  Education on better supporting our country&rsquo;s youngest dual language learners  (DLLs) in early childhood programs. The Obama Administration will be joined by  public and private sector organizations that will also announce new commitments  to support DLLs. Additionally, the White House, in collaboration with Too Small  to Fail and Invest in US, is holding a regional convening today at the United  Way Center for Excellence in Early Education in Miami, FL to highlight the  importance of supporting our country&rsquo;s DLLs in early childhood programs. </p>

<p>Data indicate that about one in five school-aged children  speak a language other than English at home, a figure that has more than  doubled in the past few decades. Estimates suggest that this number may be even  higher for learners under the age of six; for example, nearly a third of  children in Head Start programs are DLLs. Research with young DLLs clearly  reflects that children&rsquo;s bilingual skill development promotes overall language  development and should be encouraged.</p>

<p>The Federal policy statement being released today  recognizes the cultural and linguistic assets of this population of children,  and provides important resources and recommendations to the early childhood  field to ensure that our nation&rsquo;s early education programs are accessible to  these families, and that they appropriately foster the learning and development  of this large and growing group of children. Today&rsquo;s announcements also mark  progress on the President&rsquo;s My Brother&rsquo;s Keeper Initiative, which aims to  ensure that all young people, including children of color, can reach their full  potential.</p>

<p>Collectively, today&rsquo;s Federal actions include: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A New  Federal Policy Statement on More Effectively Supporting Dual Language Learners  in Early Childhood Programs: </strong> The U.S. Departments of  Health and Human Services (HHS) and Education (ED) will release a Federal  policy statement on supporting DLLs in early childhood settings. The statement  includes comprehensive policy recommendations to States and to early childhood  programs. It also recommends that States and local communities work together to  ensure that all early childhood programs are welcoming and linguistically  accessible to families of DLLs, foster children&rsquo;s emerging bilingualism and  learning more broadly, and support the early childhood workforce in building  their capacity to stimulate the learning of DLLs.</li>
<li><strong>A New DLL  Electronic Toolkit for Programs, Early Educators, Child Care Providers, and  Families: </strong> The new DLL Toolkit, released by HHS&rsquo;  Office of Head Start, includes free resources on supporting the learning and  development- including dual language development - of DLLs at home, in early  learning settings, and in the community. The DLL toolkit will be available at  no cost to all early childhood programs, including all Head Start programs,  which serve more than 300,000 DLLs every day. The toolkit will also be  disseminated to home visitors in all 50 States supported by the Maternal Infant  and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, and the families they serve.</li> 

</ul>

<p>Additional Announcements Made at Today&rsquo;s Convening  Include: </p>
<ul>


<li><strong>Too Small  to Fail, in partnership with the Early Learning Coalition of Miami- Dade and  Monroe County and Univision</strong> will launch a  new citywide &ldquo;Talking is Teaching: Talk, Read, Sing&rdquo; public awareness  campaign in Miami, with an emphasis on reaching families of young DLLs.  The campaign promotes early brain and language development by encouraging  parents to engage in meaningful activities with their young children starting  at birth -- like counting toes while giving a bath or singing a song while  changing a diaper. Miami is the seventh community with which Too Small to  Fail has partnered, with three more expected this summer. Too Small to  Fail also promoted a set of parent and early educator resources developed in  partnership with HHS and ED–- in both English and Spanish - to  encourage parents and early educators to talk, read, and sing with young DLL's  in their home language.</li>

 <li><strong>First Five  California</strong> will announce that they are developing a  $16 million DLL Pilot to identify effective culturally and linguistically  responsive strategies to better support young children who are DLLs. The pilot  will focus on three priority areas while ensuring they are scalable and  implementable across California&rsquo;s multi-lingual early learning settings. The  strategies include: professional development for early educators and program  directors on successful teaching strategies and curricula approaches to promote  dual language acquisition; proven practices to partner with families of DLLs;  and appropriate child and program assessment tools. </li>
 
<li><strong>The  University of Washington&rsquo;s Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences</strong>will release a new report on bilingual language  learning in young children. The report showcases the Institute&rsquo;s latest studies  demonstrating that the baby brain is fully capable of learning multiple  languages at the same time. The report also describes major milestones in  bilingual language learning and highlights the cognitive benefits of bilingualism,  including enhanced abilities to control attention, think flexibly, and update  information in working memory. </li>

<li><strong>The  Civil Rights Project at the University of California Los Angeles</strong> will  release a new research brief outlining the economic benefits of bilingualism in  a global economy. The report includes findings that suggest that the average  difference in earnings between a children who lose their home language,  compared to those who keep their home language and become bilingual, is more  than $5,400 annually. </li>

<li><strong>The  National Head Start Association </strong>will partner with  Head Start programs across the nation, business bureaus, and local chambers of  commerce, to develop and widely disseminate a toolkit to promote two-generation  best practices that support the parents of DLLs in areas such as job training,  enrolling in adult education programs, and accessing English language courses,  in order to foster family stability and promote child wellness. The toolkit  will include a review of best practice examples from Head Start programs that  are supporting two generation approaches for children who are DLLs and their  families, and guidance for how to replicate the best practices across the  country.</li> 

<li><strong>New  America </strong>will release a new report citing the  significance of increasing the linguistic diversity of educators in the early  childhood workforce. The report highlights the gap between the proportion of  children who speak a language other than English at home, and the proportion of  educators who speak a language other than English fluently. The authors outline  a comprehensive research agenda to identify the barriers to increasing  linguistic diversity in preschool through third grade settings, and the best  strategies to move forward. </li>

</ul>

<p>These actions build on President Obama&rsquo;s broader agenda  to expand access to high quality early education for all children. Over the  course of the President&rsquo;s time in office, he has:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Improved  and Expanded Head Start:</strong>For over 50 years, Head Start  has been at the heart of America&rsquo;s communities. From our urban and rural  neighborhoods, to our farmworker communities and tribal nations, it has played  an important role in the lives of more than 32 million children and their  families. The Obama Administration has invested an additional $4 billion  in the program, and implemented important reforms to raise Head Start&rsquo;s  standards, focus on school readiness results, and promote accountability,  including the launch of a new process designed to ensure that only the most  capable and highest quality programs receive Head Start grants. Head Start and  Early Head Start have grown by an additional 40,000 children in the years since  President Obama took office. </li>

<li><strong>Launched  the new Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships:</strong>Research  indicates that gaps in development begin to form as early as the first year of  life. Through the President&rsquo;s signature Early Head Start-Child Care  Partnerships, we have expanded access to high quality early learning  opportunities to more than 30,000 additional infants and toddlers in 275  communities across America by creating strong partnerships between our Early  Head Start grantees and child care providers that serve young children. These  Partnerships are building early learning capacity and infrastructure in the  neighborhoods across our country that need it most- and for our children who  need it most. To date, these grants are working to enhance the quality of 1200  child care centers and more than 600 family child care homes across the  country.</li>

<li><strong>Launched  the Maternal Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program: </strong>In  2009, President Obama launched the MIECHV program to support pregnant women and  families and help parents with young children tap the resources and hone the  skills they need to raise children who are physically, socially, and  emotionally healthy and ready for school. To date, the MIECHV program has  provided 2.3 million home visits, reaching nearly 150,000 families across all  50 States, the District of Columbia, and five territories. </li>

<li><strong>Signed a  new and improved child care bill into law and put forward a bold plan to expand  access to high quality affordable child care:</strong>In  2014, President Obama signed a landmark Child Care and Development Block Grant  reauthorization into law, marking a significant step forward in improving our  child care system. The new law makes important reforms including shoring up  standards that help ensure our children are safe and healthy while they are in  child care and ensuring continuity of services. It also increases the amount of  funding states can use to increase the quality of their child care systems. A  few months later, during his State of the Union address, the President put  forth a landmark child care proposal that would guarantee all eligible families  with young children have access to affordable, high quality child care. The  proposal would also ensure that child care workers have greater access to  training and higher education-- and commensurate with new competencies, higher  and more fair compensation. </li>

<li><strong>Invested  in High Quality Preschool and Proposed a Bold Plan to Expand Access to all  4-year-olds: </strong>In his 2013 State of the Union Address,  President Obama proposed a landmark plan that would ensure that all 4-year-olds  from middle- and low- income families have access to high-quality preschool.  Since his call to action, 38 states and D.C. have increased funding in their  public preschool programs, investing an additional $1.5 billion, and totaling  almost $7 billion in investments this year alone. Beyond these state  investments, the President has dedicated $750 million- through his signature  Preschool Development Grant program - in high quality preschool, so that 230  high-need communities can provide more than 100,000 additional children with  access to preschool.</li>

<li><strong>Launched  the Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC):</strong> The Obama Administration invested over $1 billion in 20 States through the  Early Learning Challenge, a competitive fund that enabled states to increase  the quality of their early education programs, to establish higher standards  across programs and to provide critical links with health, nutrition, mental  health, and family support for our neediest children.&nbsp; By December of  2014, more than 200,000 children with high needs are enrolled in the highest  quality state-funded preschool programs across the 20 States, and nearly  230,000 children with high needs are enrolled in the highest quality child care  programs. This effort has also helped to almost double the number of early  childhood programs participating in initiatives to improve their quality in  those 20 States. This effort has also helped to almost double the number of  early childhood programs participating in initiatives to improve their quality  in those 20 States.</li>


<li><strong>In  December 2014, the White House held the Summit on Early Education where  President Obama announced over $ 1 billion in new  public and private investments for early  education.</strong> More than $330 million in new actions  from corporate and philanthropic leaders and $750 million in new Federal grants  were announced to support early education. The President also released a  Playbook to offer strategies for local leaders to develop and expand early  education in their communities.</li>
