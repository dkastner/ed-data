Done well and thoughtfully, assessments are  tools for learning and promoting equity. They provide necessary  information for educators, families, the public, and students themselves to  measure progress and improve outcomes for all learners. Done poorly, in excess,  or without clear purpose, they take valuable time away from teaching and  learning, draining creative approaches from our classrooms.&nbsp; In the vital  effort to ensure that all students in America are achieving at high levels, it  is essential to ensure that tests are fair, are of high quality, take up the  minimum necessary time, and reflect the expectation that students will be  prepared for success in college and careers. </p>
<p>In  too many schools, there is unnecessary testing and not enough clarity of  purpose applied to the task of assessing students, consuming too much  instructional time and creating undue stress for educators and students. The  Administration bears some of the responsibility for this, and we are committed  to being part of the solution. </p>
<p>No  one set out to create situations where students spend too much time taking  standardized tests or where tests are redundant or fail to provide useful  information. Nevertheless, these problems are occurring in many  places—unintended effects of policies that have aimed to provide more useful  information to educators, families, students, and policymakers and to ensure  attention to the learning progress of low-income and minority students, English  learners, students with disabilities, and members of other groups that have  been traditionally underserved. These aims are right, but support in  implementing them well has been inadequate, including from this  Administration. We have focused on encouraging states to take on these  challenges and to provide them with flexibility. One of the results of this  approach is that we have not provided clear enough assistance for how to  thoughtfully approach testing and assessment.</p>
<p>What  follows is a set of principles and steps to correct the balance, protecting the  vital role that good assessment plays in guiding progress for students and  evaluating schools and educators, while providing help in unwinding practices  that have burdened classroom time or not served students or educators well. In  addition, a <a href="http://www.cgcs.org/cms/lib/DC00001581/Centricity/Domain/87/Testing%20Report.pdf">report  from the Council of the Great City Schools</a> released today will help deepen  the nation&rsquo;s understanding of these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Principles  for Fewer and Smarter Assessments</strong></p>
<p>Assessments  must be:</p>
  
<ol>
  <li><strong>Worth Taking: </strong>Testing should be a part of good  instruction, not a departure from it. A good assessment is aligned to the  content and skills a student is learning, and it requires the same kind of  complex work students do in an effective classroom – or in the real world.  Assessments should present useful information and questions that push students&rsquo;  critical thinking skills, so that students gain valuable experience even while  taking them. And assessments should provide timely, actionable feedback to  students, parents, and educators that can be used to guide instruction and  additional supports for students. They should also aid leaders&rsquo; decisions to  target resources and supports. Assessment should happen only when necessary to  accomplish those goals. No standardized test should ever be given solely for  educator evaluation.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><strong>High Quality: </strong>High-quality assessment results  in actionable, objective information about student knowledge and skills.  Assessment systems should measure student knowledge and skills against  state-developed college- and career-ready standards in a way that, as appropriate:
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Covers the full range of the relevant state  standards</strong> to ensure a full picture of what students know and can do;</li>
  <li><strong>Elicits complex student demonstrations or  applications of knowledge</strong> and skills so that teachers and parents know that  students are prepared for the real world;</li>
  <li><strong>Provides an accurate measure of student achievement</strong> for all  students, including for high- and low-achieving students, so that all educators  have the information they need to provide differentiated supports to students;  and</li>
  <li><strong>Provides an accurate measure of student growth</strong> over time to  recognize the progress that schools and educators are making to help students  succeed.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>

  <li><strong>Time-limited: </strong>While it is up to states and  districts how to balance instructional time and the need for high-quality assessments,  we recommend that states place a cap on the percentage of instructional time  students spend taking required statewide standardized assessments to ensure  that no child spends more than 2 percent of her classroom time taking these  tests. Parents should receive formal notification if their child&rsquo;s school  exceeds this cap and an action plan should be publicly posted to describe the  steps the state will take to review and eliminate unnecessary assessments, and  come into compliance. States and school districts should carefully consider  whether each assessment serves a unique, essential role in ensuring that  students are learning. 
<br /><br />
Moreover,  low-quality test preparation strategies must be eliminated.&nbsp; States,  districts, and educators should eliminate &ldquo;drill-and-kill&rdquo; test prep that is a  poor use of students&rsquo; and educators&rsquo; classroom time.&nbsp; Students do best on  high-quality assessments that actually measure critical thinking and complex  skills when they have been exposed to strong instruction, which should be the  focus.&nbsp; Districts should take concrete steps to discourage and limit the  amount of test preparation activities.<br /><br /></li>

  <li><strong>Fair – and Supportive of Fairness – in Equity in  Educational Opportunity: </strong>Assessments should be fair, including providing fair  measures of student learning for students with disabilities and English  learners. Accessibility features and accommodations must level the playing  field so tests accurately reflect what students really know and can do. The  same assessments of subjects like reading, writing, science, and math should be  given consistently statewide, so that teachers and leaders have a clear picture  of which students are meeting expectations and which students need additional  supports and interventions to succeed. Likewise, policymakers and educators  need to know which schools are seeing success with all groups of students, and  which schools are struggling and in need of different and greater supports.  States and districts should also ensure that assessments are only used for the  purposes for which they were intended and designed. Annual statewide tests are  an essential part of guiding that support.<br /><br /></li>

  <li><strong>Fully  Transparent to Students and Parents:</strong> States and districts should ensure that  every parent gets understandable information about the assessments their  students are taking, by providing information to parents on any tests students  are required to take, including (1) the purpose, (2) the source of the  requirement, (3) when the information about student performance is provided to  parents and teachers, (4) how teachers, principals, and district officials use  the information about student performance, and (5) how parents can use that  information to help their child.&nbsp; Parents, educators and, as appropriate,  students should also get the results of assessments in a timely and  understandable manner, to have a shared understanding of how students are  doing, and how educators and parents can help them succeed.<br /><br /></li>

  <li><strong>Just One of Multiple Measures: </strong>Assessments  provide critical information about student learning, but no single assessment  should ever be the sole factor in making an educational decision about a  student, an educator, or a school. Information from sources such as school  assignments, portfolios, and projects can help measure a student&rsquo;s academic performance.  In addition, factors including chronic absenteeism, student surveys, and  indicators of discipline and school climate can help create a comprehensive  understanding of students&rsquo; needs and how schools are doing. For educators,  observations of practice, student surveys, and contributions to the school  community can provide highly valuable information to ensure a comprehensive  evaluation of performance, and to help educators strengthen their skills for  the benefit of their students.<br /><br /></li>

  <li><strong>Tied to Improved Learning:</strong> While some  tests are for accountability purposes only, the vast majority of assessments  should be tools in a broader strategy to improve teaching and learning.&nbsp;  In a well-designed testing strategy, assessment outcomes are not only used to  identify what students know, but also inform and guide additional teaching,  supports, or interventions that will help students master challenging  material.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Administration Actions to Reduce  Over-Testing</h3>
<p>President  Obama has directed the Department of Education (the Department) to review its  policies to address any places where the Administration may have contributed to  the problem of overemphasis on testing burdening classroom time. As a result,  the Administration is undertaking the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Financial support for states to develop and use  better, less burdensome assessments: </strong></li><br>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Resources to focus on reviewing and eliminating  unnecessary tests and developing innovative assessments:</strong> In the  Administration&rsquo;s 2015 Enhanced Assessment Grants competition, the Department  added a focus on tools for reviewing existing assessments to ensure that each  test is of high quality, maximizes instructional goals, has a clear purpose and  utility, and is designed to help students demonstrate mastery of state standards.  This augmented the existing goals of improving the quality, validity, and  reliability of assessments, and developing innovative new assessment  instruments, such as performance and technology-based academic  assessments.</li><br>
     <li><strong>Seeking additional funding to help states conduct  assessment reviews and develop innovative assessments: </strong>In his FY16  budget proposal, President Obama called on Congress to provide support to  continue and grow this work.&nbsp; The President&rsquo;s budget included $403 million  for state assessments to provide additional resources to states to support the  effective implementation of assessments that are aligned to college- and  career-ready standards that will help ensure that all students graduate from  high school with the knowledge and skills they need to be successful in college  and the workplace.&nbsp; In addition to administering statewide assessments,  the Department encourages states to use these funds to review existing  assessments to eliminate redundancy and ensure the assessments are high-quality,  maximize instructional goals, and are designed to help students achieve state  standards. A set-aside of $25 million would support competitive projects to  help states develop innovative, new assessment models and address pressing  needs they have identified for developing and implementing their  assessments.&nbsp; This could include competency-based assessments, innovative  item types, evaluations of existing state and local assessments to reduce time  spent on testing, tools and resources to ensure greater accessibility for  students with disabilities and English learners, using technology to administer  and score assessments to improve the utility of the information about student  performance, or improving student reports to provide more diagnostic  information to parents and teachers.&nbsp; In his FY17 budget proposal,  President Obama will once again prioritize these goals.&nbsp; </li><br>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Expertise to states and school districts looking to  reduce time spent on testing:</strong></li><br>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Guidance on reducing assessments: </strong>By January 2016,  the Department will provide clear guidance to all states and districts  regarding what existing federal funds may be used for assessment audits and to  support high-quality teaching and learning, and best practices for using  testing as a learning tool. </li><br>

    <li><strong>Dedicated technical assistance: </strong>The Department  will establish &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; for any state or district that wishes to consult  on how it can best reduce testing but still meet its policy objectives and  requirements under the law; will engage in proactive outreach to states and  districts on this topic; and will bring in experts to advise the Department,  states, and districts on this work. The Department will also share tools  already available to do this work, including The Council of Chief State School  Officers&rsquo; <a href="http://ccsso.org/Resources/Publications/Comprehensive_Statewide_Assessment_Systems_A_Framework_for_the_Role_of_the_State_Education_Agency_in_Improving_Quality_and_Reducing_Burden.html"><em>Comprehensive Statewide Assessment  Systems: A Framework for the Role of the State Education Agency in Improving  Quality and Reducing Burden</em></a> and Achieve&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.achieve.org/assessmentinventory"><em>Student Assessment Inventory for School Districts</em></a>.</li><br>
     <li><strong>Technical assistance centers: </strong>The Department  will ensure that its regional and content centers and labs, including the  Center for Standards and Assessments Implementation (CSAI), provide targeted  assessment audit support to states and districts that are looking to reduce  redundant and unnecessary assessments. Furthermore, the Department will work  with its centers and labs to provide webinars and materials on the research  concerning best practice in assessment practices and the use of information on  student performance.</li><br>
 
    <li><strong>Engage local educator expertise</strong>: The Department  will work with local teachers and principals to develop and provide guidance to  states and districts on how to engage educators to review the quality and  quantity of local assessments.</li><br>
  </ul>
</li>
  <li><strong>Flexibility from federal mandates and greater  support to innovate and reduce testing:</strong></li><br>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Providing flexibility and support in non-tested  grades and subjects: </strong>The  Department will work with states that wish to amend their ESEA flexibility  waiver plans to reduce testing in grades and subjects that are not subject to  federal testing requirements and/or find alternative ways to utilize evidence  of student outcomes in the evaluation of teachers, especially in non-tested  grades and subjects, while still maintaining teacher and leader evaluation and  support systems that include growth in student learning. A later section of  this document includes some examples, and the Department will work with states  and districts to implement and share other ideas. Through the Department&rsquo;s  Office of State Support (OSS), it will proactively reach out to states to  identify potential flexibilities that they could take advantage of to reduce or  eliminate unnecessary testing.&nbsp; </li><br>
  <li><strong>Providing flexibility for innovative assessment  practices: </strong>The  Administration will invite states that wish to request waivers of federal rules  that stand in the way of innovative approaches to testing to work with the  Department to promote high-quality, comparable, statewide measures. For  example, the Department granted a temporary waiver to New Hampshire to pilot a  competency-based assessment system in four districts. This flexibility allowed  the state to give students locally developed tests – in lieu of the statewide  standardized test – that will assess students&rsquo; progress based on their ability  to apply what they know through a series of complex, multi-part tasks. This  flexibility was accompanied by a commitment to continue to report results to  parents for every student in the state and to transition back to a single  statewide measure of student learning against academic standards once the pilot  is complete.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Strengthening the peer review process: </strong>The Department  will work with external assessment experts to implement a more transparent  assessment peer review process of state assessments to better support states  and educators. The revised peer review process will support high-quality state  assessment systems and include a focus on examining the alignment and validity  of the tests, test security, and the tests&rsquo; ability to measure higher-order  thinking skills, such as analytic thinking and reasoning, to better measure  whether students are leaving high school with the knowledge and skills they  need to be ready for college or the workforce. </li><br>

  <li><strong>Avoiding double-testing: </strong>To avoid  double-testing of students, the Department will offer states flexibility from  No Child Left Behind&rsquo;s requirement that all 8th graders be tested on the same,  statewide 8th grade math and reading tests, when such students are taking  advanced high-school level coursework in 8th grade (as long as those students  take the aligned advanced assessment and take additional, advanced, high-school  level coursework and aligned assessments while enrolled in high school).  Approximately 20 states are already taking advantage of this flexibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Investing in new models: </strong>The Department  will be part of the community of researchers, technologists, and innovators  within the assessment community who are piloting new models, by providing  federal funding and incentives for these next-generation assessments and by,  where feasible, removing policy barriers to advance this goal. [<a href="fact-sheet-testing-action-plan@src=teachprep-pr.html#endnote00">i</a>]</li><br>
</ul></li>

  <li><strong>Reducing the reliance on student test scores through  our rules and executive actions:</strong></li><br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rulemaking on teacher preparation programs:</strong> Last December,  the Department of Education released a notice of proposed rulemaking to improve  the quality of teacher preparation programs by asking states to perform more  rigorous evaluations of the quality of these programs based on more useful  measures. In the proposed rule, the Department had suggested moving to a system  that would measure the quality of a program by looking at certain discrete  categories, including: success in placing teachers within a reasonable period  of time after graduation, especially in high-need schools, surveys of teachers  about the quality of their preparation, retention rates, employer surveys, and  teachers&rsquo; impact on student learning. The proposal required that states place a  significant weight on growth in student learning, including growth on statewide  standardized tests in evaluating these programs. In the coming weeks, we will  release a final rule that maintains a focus on student learning, but provides  states flexibility on how to weigh the results of statewide standardized tests  and measures of student learning more broadly in any teacher preparation  accountability system that it develops.&nbsp; As in other areas, we believe  that student learning as measured by assessment results should be a part, not  the sole determinant, of determining the quality of a particular program. </li><br>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Educator evaluation requirements:</strong> The  Administration has adjusted its policies to provide greater flexibility to  states in determining how much weight to ascribe to statewide standardized test  results in educator evaluation systems required under the Administration&rsquo;s ESEA  flexibility policy. The Administration will continue to work with states and  districts to ensure this flexibility is understood and employed, and to ensure  states and districts are focusing on improving their own capacity around the  other critical components of high-quality educator evaluations, such as student  and parent surveys, and observation and feedback systems. </li><br>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of  State and Local Leadership in Reducing Over-Testing</h3>
<p>The  nation&rsquo;s chief state school officers and local superintendents have provided  strong leadership in this area and their work deserves close attention.&nbsp;  For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>New York</strong> has worked to limit the amount of time  students spend on required state- and district-level standardized tests – no  more than 1 percent of instructional time for state-required standardized  tests, and 1 percent for locally required standardized tests. To support this  work, New York also established a &ldquo;Teaching is the Core&rdquo; competitive grant  which supported teams of administrators and teachers in reviewing all  assessments given, eliminating unnecessary ones, and improving the quality of  assessments by making them more performance-based.[<a href="fact-sheet-testing-action-plan@src=teachprep-pr.html#endnote01">ii</a>]</li><br>

  <li><strong>North Carolina</strong> worked with a team of external  researchers to conduct an analysis and produce a comprehensive report of its  federal, state, and local required assessments.[<a href="fact-sheet-testing-action-plan@src=teachprep-pr.html#endnote02">iii</a>] This report describes both the assessment requirements and strategies for  alleviating testing burden from districts across North Carolina, from other  states, and from its K-3 Formative Assessment Process. Additionally, the North  Carolina State Board of Education has convened a Task Force to focus on  reduction of testing time and burden. </li><br>

  <li>The <strong>Rhode Island</strong> Department of Education (RIDE) and the local  superintendents have joined forces to develop guidance on improving state and  local assessment decisions and practices.&nbsp; The goal of the project is to  streamline testing, eliminate tests that do not advance teaching and learning,  and ensure tests inform instruction.</li><br>

  <li><strong>In Delaware,</strong> the Governor launched a review of all  tests administered by the state, districts, and individual schools with the  goal of decreasing the testing burden on students and teachers and increasing  the time available for teaching. Delaware is providing financial resources  through the <a href="http://www.doe.k12.de.us/domain/111">Assessment Inventory Project Grants</a> so that every  district and school can conduct an in-depth inventory and review of all  assessments and develop local-level recommendations and action plans.&nbsp;  These plans will incorporate a communication component; and stakeholder groups  will be involved to ensure input and transparency.&nbsp; </li><br>

  <li>Since  2010, <strong>New Mexico</strong> has successfully decreased overall state-mandated  testing time across all grades by an average of 30 minutes per year with some  grades seeing reductions of more than three hours. The state accomplished this  while moving to implement assessments aligned with more rigorous standards;  and, today, less than 2 percent of the school year is dedicated to  state-mandated testing. The state is also partnering with districts to examine  local practices and to reduce duplicative testing.[<a href="fact-sheet-testing-action-plan@src=teachprep-pr.html#endnote03">iv</a>]</li><br>
  <li>The <strong>District of Columbia Public Schools</strong> established the Assessment Task  Force, which includes teachers and principals, to review the district&rsquo;s  assessments. </li><br>
  <li>In  February 2015, <strong>Florida</strong> announced a series of steps to reduce testing,  including enacting legislation to eliminate local final exams in  courses/subjects where there is also a statewide standardized end-of-course  exam; giving no more than one school-wide or district-wide interim assessment  per course/subject per grading period; and not testing students for the sole  purpose of evaluating teachers. According to the <a href="http://www.cgcs.org/">Council  of the Great City Schools</a> (CGCS), <strong>Duval County </strong>has <strong>&nbsp;</strong>reduced  the number of its district required elementary-level tests from 23 to 10 and  district required secondary level tests from 29 to 12. And <strong>Miami-Dade </strong>eliminated  24 district-developed benchmark assessments and 300 district developed End Of  Course (EOC) tests, according to CGCS.</li><br>
  <li>States  are working to eliminate low-quality tests taken solely for the purpose of  evaluating teachers by (1) using good tests that are or would be administered  for another purpose to measure student growth for this purpose and (2) using  non-test based indicators of student growth, such as essays and portfolios,  especially when evaluating teachers of grades and subjects for which statewide  assessments are not required by federal law. In <strong>Tennessee</strong>, arts  educators in Memphis developed a blind peer review evaluation to assess  portfolios of student learning in music and fine arts that has caught on in  other districts across the state. This reduces student assessment burden by  preventing teachers from being required to administer pre-tests for the purpose  of having a baseline student score from which to calculate student growth.  &nbsp;</li><br>
  <li>States  can include indicators of student learning, including student growth as  measured by factors other than state standardized assessments, in their teacher  evaluation policies.&nbsp; For example, as part of its ESEA waiver policy,<strong> Minnesota</strong> is approved to allow its districts to include state assessment  based growth at any percent (even less than 1 percent), which is sufficient  because Minnesota is including, as a significant factor, student learning  growth measured by factors other than the state assessment.</li><br>
  <li>States  may delay inclusion of growth on student learning based on statewide  assessments into their systems beyond school year 2015-16 as they continue to  implement and continuously improve their other measure, such as student surveys  and observations of professional practice. The <strong>District of Columbia</strong> has  temporarily removed its value-added measures from its teacher and leader  evaluation systems and continues to focus on providing quality feedback on its  Teaching and Learning Framework/Leadership Framework as a key element of the  improvement process, according to CGCS.</li><br>
  <li>States  can include growth on student learning in their educator evaluation systems  through a variety of approaches other than a specific percentage weight,  including &ldquo;matrix&rdquo; models. For example,&nbsp;<strong>Massachusetts</strong> uses a  matrix, with educator &ldquo;performance ratings&rdquo; (e.g., professional culture, parent  engagement, planning) on one axis and &ldquo;student impact ratings&rdquo; on the other, to  ensure that growth in student learning is included in a meaningful way,  balanced with other factors.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><br>
</ul>
<h3>Calling on  Congress to Reduce Over-Testing in ESEA</h3>
<p>As  Congress works to reauthorize ESEA, it should ensure that the legislation  provides the tools that parents, teachers, districts, and states need to assess  the progress that all students are making each year, including measuring  progress by each subgroup.&nbsp; It is also important that we make these  investments in a way that supports smart, effective assessments and reduces  over-testing, including language requiring states to limit classroom time spent  on statewide standardized testing. Further, legislation should require that  information from tests be shared in a timely, user-friendly, and actionable way  with parents, teachers, leaders, and students, where appropriate.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cap testing time: </strong>Congress should ensure that  states place a cap on the percentage of instructional time students spend  taking required state standardized assessments. Parents should receive formal  notification if their child&rsquo;s school exceeds this cap and an action plan should  be publicly posted to describe the steps the district will take to come into  compliance.</li><br>

  <li><strong>Better information to parents: </strong>Congress should  require each district to provide information to parents on the required tests  the states and district give, including for each assessment, (1) the purpose,  (2) the source of the requirement, (3) when the information about student  performance is provided to teachers and parents, (4) how teachers, principals,  and district officials use the information about student performance, and (5)  how parents can use that information to help their child succeed. </li><br>

  <li><strong>Use multiple measures: </strong>Congress should  ensure that states and districts use indicators of student success beyond just  standardized tests for the purposes of holding schools and educators  accountable for student progress, provided that, for schools, such measures  cannot outweigh any individual measure of academic outcomes (achievement and  graduation rates).&nbsp;</li>

  <li><strong>Invest in innovative assessments: </strong>Congress should  provide dedicated competitive funding for states with new ideas to develop  innovative ways to measure student learning.</li><br>

  <li><strong>Support state and local assessment audits: </strong>Congress should  provide funds for state and district assessment audits in an effort to  eliminate redundancy and to ensure that assessments are of high-quality,  maximize instructional goals, and are designed to help students achieve state  standards. These funds should support teams of teachers and administrators  working together to improve the quality of assessments used (e.g.,  incorporating more writing, real-world application, and critical thinking).</li><br>
  <li><strong>Ensure assessment quality: </strong>Congress should  continue to require the Department to work with external assessment experts to  ensure states are using high-quality assessments that are aligned with  state-developed standards and valid for the purposes for which they are used.  This review process must respond to changes in the field, such as accounting  for the increased prevalence of the use of technology-based assessments as well  as techniques for demonstrating their technical quality. </li><br>

  <li><strong>Maintain meaningful accountability for vulnerable  students:</strong> Congress should ensure that a new ESEA maintains its civil rights purpose and a  focus on the most vulnerable students.&nbsp; The law must require annual  assessments of all students against state-developed college- and career-ready  expectations, and must require that states and districts take action in schools  that are failing students and communities – including the lowest-performing 5 percent  of schools, schools where subgroups of students are continually falling behind,  and high schools with low graduation rates.&nbsp; The law also must ensure  accountability for states, districts, and schools that do not assess at least  95 percent of students, including in each subgroup.&nbsp; And, Congress must  ensure the Department has the authority to implement the law. </li>
</ul>

    <p><a name="endnote00"></a> [i] For example, a consortium of  states - through the Innovation Lab Network supported by the Council of Chief  State School Officers - are working to develop and implement new formative and  summative performance-based assessments that more effectively capture evidence  of student mastery of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions students need to  succeed. And a new funder collaborative comprised of national philanthropies  and foundations is investing in developing and testing new, smarter models of  student assessment. <a href="http://www.ccsso.org/What_We_Do/Innovation_Lab_Network.html">http://www.ccsso.org/What_We_Do/Innovation_Lab_Network.html</a></p>
