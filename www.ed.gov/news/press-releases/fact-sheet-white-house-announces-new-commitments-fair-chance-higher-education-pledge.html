    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>The  Obama Administration today announced that 61 higher education institutions and  systems have committed to take the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/06/10/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-fair-chance-higher-education-pledge">Fair Chance  Higher Education Pledge</a>, joining the 25 signatories that took the pledge  when it was first announced in June. In total, the 61 higher education  signatories, representing 172 individual campuses, currently serve over 1.8  million students. By signing this pledge, these higher education institutions  and systems are demonstrating an ongoing commitment to ensure that people who  have been in contact with the criminal justice system have a fair shot at a  second chance through educational opportunities. </p>
<p>During  his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/02/remarks-president-criminal-justice-reform">remarks at  Rutgers University</a> last year, the President spoke about the importance of providing second chances  through education. He discussed a smarter approach to reducing crime and  enhancing public safety that begins with investing in all of our  communities.&nbsp;He also met with participants of NJ-STEP, an initiative that  provides incarcerated individuals with the opportunity to enroll in college  courses before their release.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  people make mistakes, we have to focus on how we give them a meaningful second  chance,&rdquo; said U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. &ldquo;The signatories to  the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge are leading the way by committing to  expand educational opportunity for all. We are better off as a country if we  help those who have gotten off track get back on a pathway to success by giving  them a fair chance to successfully reintegrate and lead productive lives in our  society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today,  Secretary King and Cabinet Secretary Broderick Johnson visited Calhoun  Community College&rsquo;s postsecondary education program at Limestone Correctional  Facility in Harvest, Alabama to highlight participation in the <a href="12000-incarcerated-students-enroll-postsecondary-educational-and-training-programs-through-education-departments-new-second-chance-pell-pilot-program.html">Second Chance  Pell pilot program</a>,  which will provide nearly 12,000 incarcerated students in federal and state  penal institutes with access to Pell Grants for postsecondary education and  training programs. Calhoun Community College is partnering with Limestone  Correctional Facility and the Alabama Department of Corrections to provide  incarcerated students access to 11 training programs ranging from carpentry and  welding to horticulture and mechanical design. Students will gain experience  and instruction, and will also receive career and transition guidance as they  approach release. They will also be able to transfer accumulated credits to  another institution or may continue their education at Calhoun Community  College.</p>
<p>&quot;Reducing violence and providing  second chances to justice-involved individuals are goals at the core of the  President's My Brother's Keeper initiative,&quot; said Cabinet Secretary  Johnson. &quot;Solutions to these issues are certainly essential for bolstering  our economy, but they are also part of our moral imperative to give all  individuals the best chance to reach their full potential. We applaud the  efforts of all the organizations and institutions who have committed their  time, energy and resources to make this breakthrough program a reality.&quot;</p>
<p>By  accepting this pledge, institutions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adopting  fair chance admissions practices like the <a href="../../beyondthebox.html">Beyond the Box</a> initiative, which determines  whether justice-related questions are necessary to make an informed admissions  decision. </li>
  <li>Empowering  professors and students who want to teach or are teaching in correctional  facilities. </li>
  <li>Ensuring  internships and job training opportunities are available to individuals with  criminal records. </li>
  <li>Leading  by example in creating second chances for these individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incarceration  by the Numbers</strong><br />
The  United States currently has the highest incarceration rate in the world,  outside of a few small island nations, with approximately 2.2 million people  behind bars. <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p10.pdf">Hundreds of  thousands of individuals are released annually </a>from these  facilities. A <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR266.html">2013 study from  the RAND Corporation</a>,  funded by the Department of Justice, found that incarcerated individuals who  participated in correctional education were 43 percent less likely to return to  prison within three years than prisoners who did not participate in any  correctional education programs. RAND also estimated that for every dollar  invested in correctional education programs, four to five dollars are saved on  three-year re-incarceration costs.</p>
<p>An  estimated 70 million Americans (one in five) have some sort of criminal record.  Even after paying their debt to society, an individual&rsquo;s criminal record often  disqualifies them from obtaining employment, completing/furthering their  education, and fully re-integrating into society. </p>
<p>The  United States spends more than <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/v8_THP_10CrimeFacts.pdf">$80  billion</a> annually on corrections. The Department of Education recently  released a report, <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/other/expenditures-corrections-education/brief.pdf"><em>Trends in State  and Local Expenditures on Corrections and Education</em></a>, which shows  state and local spending on prisons and jails has increased at triple the rate  of funding for public education for P-12 education in the last three decades.  Even when population changes are factored in, 23 states increased per capita  spending on corrections at more than double the rate of increases in per-pupil  P-12 spending.</p>
<p><strong>Fair  Chance Higher Education Pledge </strong><br />
<em>We applaud the growing number  of public and private colleges and universities nationwide who are taking  action to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed, including  individuals who have had contact with the criminal justice system. When an estimated 70 million or more Americans&#151;nearly one in three adults &#151; have a criminal record, it is important to remove unnecessary barriers that may prevent these individuals from gaining access to education and training that can be so critical to career success and lead to a fulfilled and productive life. We are committed to providing individuals with criminal records, including formerly incarcerated individuals, a fair chance to seek a higher education to obtain the knowledge and skills needed to contribute to our Nation's growing economy.</em></p>
<p>Institutions interested in joining  the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge can do so by signing up <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/criminal-justice/fair-chance-pledge#section-355371">HERE</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Today&rsquo;s signatories include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr.  Freeman Hrabowski, president, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC): </strong>&ldquo;We support the  Department of Education's &lsquo;Beyond the Box&rsquo; initiative as we continue to work to  create equitable access for students. UMBC is committed to inclusive excellence  and we applaud the Administration's efforts to make it easier for qualified  students to pursue their education.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Muriel  A. Howard, Ph.D. President American Association of State Colleges and  Universities: </strong>&ldquo;I  am pleased to see that the Administration has taken a constructive and balanced  approach to a complex and important issue—one that is too often oversimplified  in public discourse. The report published today, Beyond the Box, provides  thoughtful and actionable advice to campus officials regarding admissions  practices for prospective students with previous encounters with the justice  system. Education is universally viewed as a transformative experience that  improves both the individual student and the community. Broader access to  higher education for underserved groups benefits the entire nation and should  be a priority and a common goal for all of us. AASCU looks forward to working  with the Administration and our members on the issues addressed by Beyond the  Box.&rdquo; </p>
<p><strong>President  Michael M. Crow, Arizona State University: </strong>&ldquo;&lsquo;Beyond the Box&rsquo; proposes that,  by expanding access to higher education, potential students who otherwise would  eschew college instead can be empowered with the single greatest determinant of  social mobility — a college education. At ASU we judge success not by whom we  exclude, but by whom we include and how they succeed and we pride ourselves on  enabling students to find individual paths to success. Our nation needs more  universities to develop ways of helping more people achieve their dreams by  opening new paths to obtaining a post-secondary education.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Chancellor  Nancy L. Zimpher, State University of New York:</strong> &ldquo;I commend the  U.S. Department of Education for its leadership on this issue, one that has  challenged public universities across the country. In our continuing effort to  provide all New Yorkers access to a quality, affordable higher education that  prepares them for success in college and career, and at the direction of our  Board of Trustees, SUNY has also been evaluating its application process with  regard to those individuals that have a record with the justice system. This  federal guidance comes at an ideal time in SUNY's own review, as our  system-wide workgroup is finishing its vital consultation with campuses and  preparing to bring recommendations to our Board. In addition, our system-wide  Student Assembly recently passed its own progressive resolution recommending we  &lsquo;move the box.&rsquo; We look forward to reviewing the &lsquo;Beyond the Box&rsquo; guide in full  so that we can align SUNY's effort. I commend United States Secretary of  Education John B. King Jr. and the Department of Education for their leadership  in removing barriers in the higher education admissions process for formerly  incarcerated individuals.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Chancellor  James B. Milliken, City University of New York: </strong>&ldquo;The City  University of New York has been at the forefront of promoting alternatives to  incarceration to help rehabilitate at-risk individuals and break the cycle of  mass incarceration. Earlier this year, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced CUNY and  SUNY would develop a statewide plan to provide college instruction in prison  and allow participants to continue their educational progress in the community  after being released from prison. At CUNY, our college admissions offices have  long been leaders in considering student applicants who have paid their debt to  society while refraining from asking about their criminal records. A college  education is vital to accessing opportunities. This will ensure that when  incarcerated individuals leave prison and return to our communities, they have  the education and skills they need to obtain employment and contribute  positively to society. We endorse the principles inherent in the &ldquo;Beyond the  Box&rdquo; initiative and look forward to maintaining and expanding CUNY&rsquo;s leadership  in ensuring that educational opportunities are available and encouraged for  those who have been involved with the criminal justice system.&rdquo; <br />
  <br />
  <strong>New York University Spokesman John Beckman: </strong>&ldquo;We think the Dept. of  Education's announcement today is a good step forward. It will be an important  part of the ongoing national conversation about balancing campus safety with  higher education's mission as an engine of opportunity and social mobility. To  that end, we are also pleased that the Common App -- which NYU and hundreds of  other colleges use for admissions, and which NYU wrote to about this issue in  January -- last week notified its membership that it is moving forward with  research on these very questions. These are positive, productive developments  on this important topic in higher education.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Obama  Administration Commitment to Criminal Justice Reform </strong><br />
Since  President Obama took office, this Administration has been committed to  reforming America's criminal justice system. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/14/remarks-president-naacp-conference">Last summer, the  President spoke</a> about  the importance of reducing barriers facing people who have been in contact with  the criminal justice system and are trying to put their lives back on track. He  then became <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/16/remarks-president-after-visit-el-reno-federal-correctional-institution">the first  President to visit a federal prison</a> where he sat down with individuals  who would be returning to their communities. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/02/remarks-president-criminal-justice-reform">In November</a>, President  Obama also announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/02/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-new-actions-promote-rehabilitation">new efforts by  this Administration</a> to  help formerly incarcerated individuals to rehabilitate and reintegrate back  into their communities, including an Office of Personnel Management proposed  rule that would &ldquo;ban the box,&rdquo; delaying inquiries into criminal history until  later in the federal hiring process.</p>
<p>The  White House also <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/11/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-fair-chance-business-pledge">launched the  Fair Chance Business Pledge</a>, a call-to-action for all members of the private  sector to improve their communities by eliminating barriers in employment for  those with a criminal record and creating a pathway for a second  chance.</p>
<p>The  Department of Education has worked to ensure everyone has a fair chance at  pursuing their education. The Department, in partnership with the Department of  Justice&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ojjdp.gov/">Office of Juvenile Justice and  Delinquency Prevention</a>, created a $5.7 million <a href="education-department-announces-new-tools-support-successful-reentry-formerly-incarcerated-youth-and-adults.html">grant program</a> aimed at  improving outcomes for students who have been involved in the criminal justice  system by providing career and technical education, and released a <a href="http://lincs.ed.gov/reentryed/">toolkit</a> providing guidance to educators  and others to support a successful reentry system for formerly incarcerated  youth and adults. The Department also recently <a href="education-department-pushes-alternatives-criminal-history-questions-college-admissions.html">called on  colleges and universities</a> to remove barriers that can prevent the estimated  70 million citizens with criminal records from pursuing higher education,  including considering the chilling effect of inquiring early in the application  process whether prospective students have ever been arrested. </p>
<p>The  Fair Chance in Higher Education Pledge, the Fair Chance Business Pledge and  Second Chance Pell all respond to recommendations presented to President Obama  by the My Brother's Keeper (MBK) Task Force in May of 2014 to &quot;Eliminate  Unnecessary Barriers to Reentry and Encourage Fair Chance Hiring Options.&quot;  The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/my-brothers-keeper">My Brother's  Keeper Initiative</a>,  launched by President Obama in February of 2014, brings together partners from  the federal government, state and local government and the private sector to  address persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color and  ensure all youth can reach their full potential. MBK is one of several  Administration initiatives designed to expand opportunity for underserved young  people and disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline. In 2011, the U.S. Departments  of Education and Justice announced the launch of a collaborative project – <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/appendix-3-overview.pdf">the Supportive  School Discipline Initiative</a> – to support the use of school  discipline practices that foster safe, supportive, and productive learning  environments while keeping students in school. Recently, the Administration  announced new tools to improve school climates by working with states, schools,  and their law enforcement partners to assess the proper role of school resource  officers and campus law enforcement professionals. Both the Education  Department and the Justice Department's <a href="http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/">Office of Community Oriented Policing Services</a> released  letters to states and districts on the importance of well-designed school  resource officer programs, and encouraged leaders of institutions of higher  education to commit to implementing recommendations from the <a href="http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/taskforce_finalreport.pdf">President's Task  Force on 21st Century Policing</a> in the campus policing context.</p></div></div></div>  </div>
