King Jr.</a> today  announced a new grant competition to support districts and their communities in  preparing to implement innovative, comprehensive, collaborative, and  locally-driven strategies to increase diversity in schools. King also announced  the <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/magnet/index.html">2017 Magnet  Schools Assistance Program</a> competition, which will provide  districts with funds to help create integrated public schools and support  high-quality, theme-based educational programming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, we are taking another step toward helping schools create  and maintain diversity,&rdquo; said King. &ldquo;We must support local communities in their  efforts as diversity is critical for a well-rounded education. Together, our  nation can choose a better future for our children‚Äîone that prepares all  students to live, work and compete in our increasingly interconnected, global  economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-29936.pdf">Opening Doors,  Expanding Opportunities</a><strong> </strong>is a new grant  competition that will support districts in increasing socioeconomic diversity  in schools, improving student academic achievement, and improving schools by  increasing student diversity. </p>
<p>As part of this new competition, the Department will invest $12  million in up to 20 districts or groups of districts to fund the development of  blueprints for increasing socioeconomic diversity in schools and complete  pre-implementation activities focused on student diversity. Grantees may also  seek to promote student diversity by considering additional factors beyond  socioeconomic diversity, including race and ethnicity, in their efforts to  diversify schools. Grantees will use funds to, for example, engage the  community on the best approaches to promote student diversity, conduct data  analysis, set measureable diversity goals, and take preliminary steps toward  implementation of school diversity efforts (e.g. piloting activities such as  admissions lotteries or redesigned school assignment boundaries). Rural  districts and those that wish to exploreinter-district diversity  efforts are strongly encouraged to apply and will receive priority. All  districts with schools that receive or are eligible to receive <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/sif/index.html">School Improvement Grant</a> funds may apply to the competition, which is open until Feb. 13, 2017. The  Department anticipates selecting the grantees by Spring 2017. </p>
<p>The 2017 Magnet Schools Assistance Program provides resources  for district efforts to create schools that effectively serve students from  varied racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. These five-year, $15 million  grants represent an increase in both the grant duration and the total grant  amount in order to help schools undertake the longer-term efforts that can  successfully improve a school&rsquo;s diversity integration and academic performance.  Applications are due by April 11, 2017. </p>
<p>King made these announcements today during a visit to Goldsmith  Elementary in Louisville, Kentucky, where he was joined by Congressman  John Yarmuth, Mayor Greg Fischer, Jefferson County Superintendent Donna  Hargens, district and community leaders, students, parents, and educators.  Louisville has become a leader in school integration following a court ruling  in the 1970s that required more diverse schools. Since that ruling, communities  in Louisville have committed to maintaining racial and economic diversity. </p>
<p>From Louisville to Omaha to Cambridge, Massachusetts,  communities across the country are voluntarily and intentionally pursuing  diversity because they recognize its impact on strong teaching and learning.  But there is more work to be done.</p>
<p>Research shows that diversity in schools and communities is  associated with positive academic and life outcomes. But schools are only one  aspect of increasing diversity in the nation&rsquo;s communities. Communities can and  should work together across local education, transportation, and housing and  community-development agencies to help create and sustain access to  high-quality educational opportunities, safe and affordable housing, and  well-connected public transportation networks and safer streets. </p>
<p><a href="../speeches/stronger-together-need-diversity-americas-schools.html">In July, King  addressed the National PTA</a> and noted the importance of diversity &ldquo;&#8230;not just in schools, but also in classrooms within those schools. It's not  just enough for kids from diverse backgrounds to pass each other in the  hallways or on the playground. True diversity requires students to actually  learn alongside one another. That's not something that will happen by itself.  That requires decisions by policymakers at every level&#8230;&rdquo;</p>
<p>King continued, &ldquo;The benefits of diversity extend beyond  academics. In today&rsquo;s world, your boss may not look like you, your office-mate  may not worship like you, your neighbor may not speak the same language as you,  and your customer may not live on the same continent as you.&rdquo; <br />
  <br />
  Schools today must prepare students for this new reality.  Diversity in education‚Äîcultural, racial, linguistic and socioeconomic‚Äîcan help  boost empathy, reduce bias, and increase the chances that low-income students  will attend college without compromising the academic outcomes of their middle  class peers in any way. It exposes students to new perspectives and a healthy  exchange of ideas that will help enlarge their world views. Diversity also  increases the likelihood students will succeed and become leaders in their  careers and communities by working with individuals with different lived  experiences. Studies show that companies reporting the highest levels of racial  diversity brought in nearly 15 times more sales revenue on average than those  with the lowest levels of racial diversity. </p>
<p>President Obama&rsquo;s FY 2017 <a href="../../content/equity-and-excellence-president‚%2580%2599s-budget-education.html">Stronger  Together budget proposal</a> supports the voluntary development  and expansion of new and existing, community-driven strategies to increase  socioeconomic diversity in America&rsquo;s schools. Additionally, as states are  implementing the <em>Every Student Succeeds Act</em>, the nation has an opportunity  to advance equity and reclaim the promise of an excellent education for  students from all backgrounds.</p>
<p>The Department has supported school diversity in a number of  ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Along with the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and  Transportation, the Department issued a <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/06032016-dear-colleagues-letter.pdf">joint letter</a> to state and local leaders calling on them to work together to create real  economic mobility and provide access to opportunities for every child in every  community by identifying and addressing barriers in their communities that  hinder socioeconomic growth and racial diversity.</li>
  <li>The Department&rsquo;s recent <a href="us-department-education-launches-65-million-grant-competition-creating-expanding-high-quality-public-charter-schools.html">Charter Schools  Program</a>, <a href="us-department-education-marks-success-investing-innovation-i3-and-launches-seventh-and-final-i3-competition.html">Investing in  Innovation</a>, and <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/magnet/index.html">Magnet Schools Assistance Program</a> grant competitions include a focus on fostering diversity  in schools. The Department also published a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/06/08/2016-13456/supplemental-priority-for-discretionary-grant-programs">new supplemental  priority</a> that will be used in future Department grant competitions  to support socioeconomic diversity strategies.</li>
  <li>Socioeconomic diversity is now a focus area of the  Department&rsquo;s <a href="../../content/proposed-priority-and-requirement-equity-assistance-centers-formerly-desegregation-assistance-centers-dac.html">Equity  Assistance Centers.</a> These regional centers provide technical assistance to  school districts to promote equal educational opportunities.</li>
