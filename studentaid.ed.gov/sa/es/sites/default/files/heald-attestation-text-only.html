FOR BORROWER DEFENSE TO REPAYMENT LOAN DISCHARGE<BR>FORM APPROVED OMB NO: 
1845-0132 Exp. 12/31/2015<BR><BR>The Department of Education has found that at 
various times between 2010 and 2014, Heald College published misleading job 
placement rates for many of its programs of study. This form is designed to 
expedite the process of obtaining loan forgiveness based on borrower defense to 
repayment for loans taken out by Heald College students to enroll in these 
programs. This form covers federal Direct Loans received on or after July 1, 
2010. A list of covered programs and dates of enrollment is available at 
https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/heald-findings.pdf. Please fill 
out this attestation ONLY IF your program and dates of enrollment are included 
on this list. <BR><BR>Heald College students who did not attend programs where 
the Department of Education found misleading job placement rates, or whose 
decision to enroll was not influenced by those job placement rates, may still be 
eligible for loan forgiveness based on borrower defense to repayment. Additional 
instructions to file a claim for loan forgiveness can be found at 
studentaid.ed.gov.<BR><BR>Instructions: Please complete this form. To sign the 
form, insert a digital image of your signature in the appropriate field below or

Prior to my enrollment in this Heald College program, I received information 
about job placement rates related to my program of study through one or more of 
the following ways (check each that applies)<BR><BR>__Brochures advertising 
Heald College's academic programs or other printed materials, including those 
provided by Heald College representatives or recruiters;<BR><BR>__Emails, online 
materials, or online disclosures from or by Heald College.<BR><BR><BR>2. I 
believed that the job placement rates related to my program of study indicated 
the level of quality a Heald education offered to students. I chose to enroll at 
Heald based, in substantial part, on the information I received about job 
placement rates related to my program of study and the quality of education I 
believed those placement rates represented.<BR><BR>3. I applied for and received 
a federal Direct Loan to cover the cost of attendance of the Heald program in 
which I enrolled.<BR><BR>4. As an attachment to this attestation, I have 
included documents(s) with additional information to confirm that I was enrolled 
in the program of study at Heald College that I identified above, and was 
enrolled for the dates I provided above. (Suggested documents include 
transcripts and registration documents indicating your specific program of study 
at Heald College and dates of enrollment.) The document(s) I have attached

<H2>SECTION IV: DIRECT LOAN FORBEARANCE </H2>By completing this form, you are 
eligible to have all of your federal loans placed into forbearance and for 
collections on any federal loans in default to stop while your claim is reviewed 
by the Department of Education. Please read the following information carefully 
before making your selection below.<BR>During any period that your loans are in 
forbearance, you do not have to make payments on those loans, and the loans will 
not go into default. If your loans are already in default, collections will 
stop. This will continue until the loan discharge review process is completed. 
Your servicer will notify you when your loan has been placed into forbearance or 
stopped collections. Until you receive that notice, you should continue to make 
payments.<BR><BR>The forbearance or stopped collections will affect all of a 
borrower's federal loans, including loans that are not eligible for discharge 
through this form, such as Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL), loans taken 
out to attend a Heald College program not on the enclosed list of covered 
programs, or loans taken out to attend another institution.<BR><BR>Note that 
interest will continue to accrue on all of these federal loans, including 
subsidized loans, during the forbearance or stopped collections 
period.<BR><BR>If you want the forbearance or stopped collections to apply only 
to those loans that may be eligible for a discharge using this form (federal 
Direct Loans received on or after July 1, 2010 to attend Heald College programs 
covered by the enclosed list), you must notify your loan servicer. At any time 
during the forbearance or stopped collections period, you may voluntarily make 
payments on your loans, including payments for accrued interest, or end the 
forbearance or stopped collections by contacting your servicer.<BR><BR>If your 
claim made using this form is successful, your federal Direct Loans borrowed to 
attend a covered Heald College program will be discharged. Also at that time, 
the forbearance or stopped collections period for your other federal loans will 
end. You will be responsible for repaying these other remaining loans, including 
interest that accrued during the forbearance or stopped collections period, 
under the terms of your promissory note.<BR><BR>If your claim is denied, you 
will not receive a discharge of any of your loans and the forbearance or stopped 
collections period will end for all of your loans. You will be responsible for 
repaying these loans, including interest that accrued during the forbearance or 
stopped collections period, under the terms of your promissory note. <BR><BR>__ 
Yes, I want my federal loans to be placed in forbearance and for collections to 
stop on any loans in default while my loan discharge claim is 
reviewed.<BR><BR>__ No, I do not want my federal loans to be placed in 
forbearance and for collections to stop on any loans in default while my loan 
discharge claim is reviewed.<BR>
<H2>SECTION V: CERTIFICATION </H2>By signing this attestation I certify 
that:<BR><BR>I agree to provide, upon request, testimony, a sworn statement, or 
other documentation reasonably available to me that demonstrates to the 
satisfaction of the Department of Education or its designee that I meet the 
qualifications for borrower defense to repayment loan discharge. <BR><BR>All of

Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program, and giving us your SSN are voluntary, but 
you must provide the requested information, including your SSN, to participate. 
The principal purposes for collecting the information on this form, including 
your SSN, are to verify your identity, to determine your eligibility to receive 
a loan or a benefit on a loan (such as a deferment, forbearance, discharge, or 
forgiveness) under the Direct Loan Program, FFEL, or Perkins Loan Programs, to 
permit the servicing of your loan(s), and, if it becomes necessary, to locate 
you and to collect and report on your loan(s) if your loan(s) becomes delinquent 
or defaults. We also use your SSN as an account identifier and to permit you to 
access your account information electronically. The information in your file may 
be disclosed, on a case-by-case basis or under a computer matching program, to 
third parties as authorized under routine uses in the appropriate systems of

limited to, its disclosure to federal, state, or local agencies, to private 
parties such as relatives, present and former employers, business and personal 
associates, to consumer reporting agencies, to financial and educational 
institutions, and to guaranty agencies in order to verify your identity, to 
determine your eligibility to receive a loan or a benefit on a loan, to permit 
the servicing or collection of your loan(s), to enforce the terms of the 
loan(s), to investigate possible fraud and to verify compliance with federal 
student financial aid program regulations, or to locate you if you become 
delinquent in your loan payments or if you default. To provide default rate 
calculations, disclosures may be made to guaranty agencies, to financial and 
educational institutions, or to state agencies. To provide financial aid history 
information, disclosures may be made to educational institutions. To assist 
program administrators with tracking refunds and cancellations, disclosures may 
be made to guaranty agencies, to financial and educational institutions, or to 
federal or state agencies. To provide a standardized method for educational 
institutions to efficiently submit student enrollment statuses, disclosures may 
be made to guaranty agencies or to financial and educational institutions. To 
counsel you in repayment efforts, disclosures may be made to guaranty agencies, 
to financial and educational institutions, or to federal, state, or local 
agencies. In the event of litigation, we may send records to the Department of 
Justice, a court, adjudicative body, counsel, party, or witness if the 
disclosure is relevant and necessary to the litigation. If this information, 
either alone or with other information, indicates a potential violation of law, 
we may send it to the appropriate authority for action. We may send information 
to members of Congress if you ask them to help you with federal student aid 
questions. In circumstances involving employment complaints, grievances, or 
disciplinary actions, we may disclose relevant records to adjudicate or 
investigate the issues. If provided for by a collective bargaining agreement, we 
may disclose records to a labor organization recognized under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 
71. Disclosures may be made to our contractors for the purpose of performing any 
programmatic function that requires disclosure of records. Before making any 
such disclosure, we will require the contractor to maintain Privacy Act 
safeguards. Disclosures may also be made to qualified researchers under Privacy 
Act safeguards.
